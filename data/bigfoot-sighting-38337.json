  "observed": "I found tracks in the mud last week a few days after my sister said she had one behind her house. So I went out last Monday and tracked it for about a half mile until I lost the trail. She said there is a smell that she smells before she sees. It smells like a skunk mixed with cow crap. I was there for three nights trying to find it and I couldn't find it. The day after I left to go back home it came back and she tried to get a picture of it before it ran off in to the woods.",

She is not inclined to repeat the old stories she has heard all her life and has never thought it was real. Well today she has a new respect for those stories, she has said that she was driving on County Road 10 in Miller County, Arkansas going west about a mile or so from Hwy. 237 in Fouke, AR, when it crossed the road right in front of her car.",

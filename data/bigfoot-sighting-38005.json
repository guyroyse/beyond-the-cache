  "observed": "Just got home around 9 pm, walked into the house.  Turned on overhead light in living room, was standing behind recliner waiting for my wife to remove her coat and put it in the hall closet. The windows to the south, saw an upright creature walk past the window on the deck attached to the house.  Could not determine the height, was poor visibility.  Creature was sandy brown in color, had short, very clean wavy hair.  Waves were in verticle appearance, not horizontal.  Over the years, we have heard vocalization and loud bangs (only one at a time).  This activity occurs in the months of October/November.  I do not believe that they reside here, I think they are moving south for the winter.  Our house is on a high promenade high above a valley.  This seems to be a runway for all animals.",

  "observed": "About 12 years ago Carla, Cindy and myself, Brian, took a road trip to Brown creek, in Washington state. Went down a dirt road to the end where it met the river. I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off. A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there. The top turned again looking at us all, approx 25 yards away, we ran as fast as we could to the van in which you could see where this happened but nothing was there. I won't go back without protection.",

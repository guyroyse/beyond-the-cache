  "observed": "This incident happened 20 yrs ago. I don't know if this is too long ago for your research but I will tell you. I am 31 years old. When I was 10 or 11 years old I was riding my horse in the summer time in a wooded area bordering the wilderness area of the Rattlesnake Wilderness in the outskirts of Missoula MT, and my horse stopped dead in his tracks as we rode through a meadow (that now has 3 houses in it). There I was, face to face with a bigfoot that was about 10 feet away from me. It was peeking out from behind a tree. (just like the 3rd drawing in this web page [http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm]) It just stood there looking at me and didn't make a sound. I slowly turned my horse around and ran home. It must have stood at least 7 or more feet taller than myself. That was the only time I witnessed one.",

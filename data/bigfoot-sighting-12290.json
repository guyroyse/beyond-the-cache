  "observed": "What was seen was a Hairy Animal on two feet running towards us on a wet rainy night...It was late one night about 3:00am... I was driving from Houston Texas from a job interview, I had been driving all night long, and My Mom was with me because she decided to go, and we were almost home when it began raining. I'd say we had about 20 more miles to Meridian, somewhere between Enterprise and Meridian on Interstate 59..I was going about 55mph because of the rain. I noticed a large figure to the left of the Jeep running towards us. I looked at my Mom and asked her if she had seen what I seen, and she said yes. I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us. We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot. I hunt alot, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot... This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall... Scared the Hell out of us.I don't know what else it could have been if not a bigfoot.",

  "observed": "My dad and I had just got set up to start deer hunting.  I had a ways to walk further south then he had to.  I saw his flashlight bobbin in the woods to my right (south) as I headed to my blind. He got into position, kicked up something that smelled awful.  This thing was crashing through the woods like a freight train.  It was too loud to be a deer,as it crashed right by me in the dark, smelling awful. i didn't know what it was, but was frightened sitting there in the dark until it got light out.",

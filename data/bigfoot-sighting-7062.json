  "observed": "My sighting happened on November 21, 2002, on or about 7:30am in Catoosa, Rogers County, Oklahoma. I work in a dental office, and happened to look out of the window and saw what I automatically knew was a bigfoot/sasquatch, walking beside an abandoned house. It was very dark brown or nearly black, thick neck with broad shoulders,and had a wide skull, it was at least 7ft.tall. I only saw the backside of the animal. I can best describe it as primate looking animal that stood more upright than a gorilla but somewhat stooped, it slowly swung its arms, and had a slight knee bend.",

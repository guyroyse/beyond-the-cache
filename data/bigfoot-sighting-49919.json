Where we work is pretty remote, southeast Iron county close to Madison County line. It was a cool, cloudless, quiet, full moon night. I know this because we were discussing how well we could see the stars that night. The three of us were looking up at the stars when we heard a howling noise which lasted at least 10-15 seconds. We were at an awe on what it could have been. We are all hunters and have plenty of time in the woods. This was no sound we had ever heard before.  After doing some research online we've all come to the conclusion what we heard was a sasquatch Aka big foot.",

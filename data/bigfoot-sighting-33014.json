  "observed": "This happened around August/September of 1973 time frame.  My friend and I were walking down some railroad tracks near the Ohio river.  We were walking from East Liverpool to Wellsville Ohio, just below Route 7.  When we started out our walk, the sun was just about ready to set.  I would say it was about 7:30 or 8:00 o'clock in the evening.  When we got about 1/2 mile into it, we heard this noise, (sounded like some brush being stompped down), on the side of the hill and we looked up.  There stood this enormous hairy figure looking down at us from about 25 yards away.  He was leaning out from behind this tree and his arm was wrapped around it.  It was very tall, with big arms.  I ran as fast as I could as well did my friend, back the other way.  I told my parents about this and all they did is laugh at me and told me that there is no such thing.  I'm 48 years old now and I still know what my friend and I saw.  I believe in Bigfoot and believe that they are descendants of cavemen that have never evolved.",

  "observed": "On the night of Friday May 15, 2009 I went out on the back porch to get some fresh air. I smelled something like a wet dog. When I turned around I saw a seven or eight feet tall creature that was brown, hairy, and kind of lanky. As soon as I saw it I gasped and it took off running. Then next morning my family and I went outside and began looking around and found footprints about 14\" or 15\" inches long, and 4 or 5 feet span between each one in our garden. It appeared to be barefooted and at one point running.",

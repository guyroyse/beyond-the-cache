  "observed": "I was pulling out of my driveway getting ready to leave for work as I looked to the left I noticed movement on the embankment by the road. I sat watched for a little while and a very very large dark cone headed type person animal whatever you want to call it took a step and was in the middle of the road.  It just stood there like it was watching me watching it. It stood there for a few mins and turned and walked across the street into underbrush and trees over by the creek.  I waited a little longer and it never came back out so I went to work.  This started a sort of strange animals being seen around here and heard.  My father claimed to keep seeing a very large brownish black bear across the street. The next door neighbors grandson was playing in the back yard and came around front and told us there was a big gorilla in the backyard.  The sound I have heard at night is a cross between a scream, howl and growl and some nights you can smell a very heavy wet  dog smell with a hint of mildew mixed in.",

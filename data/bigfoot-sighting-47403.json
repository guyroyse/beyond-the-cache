  "observed": "I'm a retired paranormal and cryptid researcher and I had a personal encounter this year while deer hunting in Shelby County Illinois which is considered south central Illinois. I will not disclose the exact location but I will say it happened in a very well known state park. I had two encounters in two days one after another. The first was a grey color and second one was a dark black color. The second encounter I got a series of pics that aren't the best but show a dark figure walking away. I have the details all recorded and theories as to why in the area that I have seen these creatures. I am also a well known tracker and guide in the area and I know my wildlife very well. If u would like to know more please contact me. I'm submitting this thru my phone and kind of difficult. On a side note I'm not some young kid I'll be 41 yrs old soon.",

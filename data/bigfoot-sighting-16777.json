  "observed": "In early June we were sleeping in back of truck when my wife woke up and saw something big walk past the truck. It went over to where I had our trash bags (10-20 feet from truck) tied up in a tree to keep animals away.The bags contained the remains of a chicken we had cooked over the fire, plus other garbage.I am 5'8\" and had the bags tied up high enough that I could not reach them. You could see the white bags moving as it reached up and grabbed one of the bags out of the tree. I had my wife crawl through the window into the cab and honk the horn. It just turned and looked at us but did not run off. It always stayed on two legs and looked wider and taller than a bear. After taking one bag it went off into the woods and you could hear it tearing open the bag and eating the contents.About a half hour later it came back into the camp and took the other bag out of the tree.I had a flash light but did not leave the truck to get a good look at it. We could only see its shape when it was getting the bags. After taking the last bag and leaving I had my wife hold the pistol while I got out and threw everything into the truck and we left and spent the rest of the night in a pull off near interstate 64.",

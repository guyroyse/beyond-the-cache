  "observed": "Me and my brother was fishing in a local pond for bass on a john boat in the evening and we were just talking back and forth when this thing non human or not a bear bent over from the edge of the palmettos and stuck both hands in water and was drinking from its hands . It stared at us like it hadn't a care in the world . Eyes were dark looking had reddish brown hair that had a shine to it in the sun .Looked to be about 7' or taller . Had us pretty scared as my car was parked just 100 feet we had seen it . It never made a sound when it came in to drink and no sounds when it left . We hurried up and left there never to go back and didn't tell but a couple people in the past years. It is something that has no explaination so we just try to forget it . Never tried to harm us or make any contact but the thought of it still raises the hair on my neck. It had really large hands and it kinda sit on its legs when crouched down there was a musky odor like a deer in rut smell. Just happened so fast been hard to remember it only was there for a couple minutes after seeing us. Thank god.",

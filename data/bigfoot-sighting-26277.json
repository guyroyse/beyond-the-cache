  "observed": "I and my girlfriend were riding in my Jeep on Route 140 from New Bedford to Freetown tonight (July 14, 2009) and at about 11:00 my girlfriend seen this large brown hair covered \"man\" standing up from a crouched position on the side of the two lane highway. She lets out a scream prompting me to look at the creature standing there. He made fluid movements like a man and had an almost ape-like quality. We couldn't see his face but upon returning to the area we saw the \"man\" there was nothing. After calling 911 and telling them that someone was running in the median of the highway they told us that they had similar reports of what we saw on the stretch of highway between exit 7 (Braley rd.) and exit 8 (Chase Rd.) They then told me that they were sending state troopers to investigate.",

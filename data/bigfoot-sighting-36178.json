We were on a double lane highway in south eastern AR when I saw a tall, large, greyish haired creature standing on his legs, run across the highway about 300 feet in front of my van. It never looked at me, it just ran across the highway. I was so shaken up by what I saw. It was like a human but big and grey haired.",

  "observed": "Two weeks ago my and my girlfriend were out hunting when we seen something running down the road. it was large and hairy and moved like a mother [It moved fast]. We seen it about 40 to 30 yards away and were already driving kinda fast. I am guessing about 15 to 10 miles an hour. My girlfriend ask me \"what is that\" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road. I drove up the road toward the place it was seen. when I reached the place it was already gone. I grabbed my pistol and jumped out to look up the ridge in the direction it was running, nothing, no noise, nothing. My girlfriend was scared and yelling at me to get back in. Most of the time you hear something running away or hear the hops of a deer running hard, but there was nothing. I backed up the truck to look at the road where it had run and it left no track what so ever. if it was a bear it would have left it's claw print in the hard surface sand. but there was nothing and I looked well. I could see how a big flat foot would leave no print. I asked her what she saw and she said it looked like a large man, she was sure it was a man type animal. you have to take into consideration this all happened in a matter of about 3 to 4 seconds, I mean the first sighting to stoping the car and jumping out. so it all happened fast. so you can guess that puppy was moving. and it was in a place he could not hide to well, no real buck brush or anything.",

  "observed": "At last I have found a legitimate place to report a sighting that occurred about 25 years ago. It was in August of 1977. I had gone hiking in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area in Washington. The trailhead is at the end of the West Fork Foss River road. The snow had remained for several weeks longer than normal, and I had to use the ice axe in a couple of places to reach Copper Lake.  I stayed there only long enough to boil some water for tea, and then took the trail back down to Trout Lake and on to the trailhead. I got in the car and started back down toward US Highway 2. I had gone about a half-mile, and on rounding a bend in the road, I saw a tall, dark creature cross the road about 50 yards in front of me. I judged it to be about 8 feet tall, and it was definitely of a humanlike body shape. I have often observed bears, and this was no bear!  Bears do not cross a road on their hind legs, although they may rear up at times. I never got a look at the face, as it was turned away from me. After crossing the road, it went up a bank that was so steep no human could have climbed it without traveling on all fours, and it remained upright. This was a creature such as I had never seen before, not since.",

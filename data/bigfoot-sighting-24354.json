  "observed": "I was deer hunting in Pike County, Illinois in 2007. I got in my tree stand at 6 in the morning. At 6.20 in the morning I heard loud footsteps walking through the pasture off to my right shoulder. I thought it was another hunter going to the third pasture to his ground blind. I stood up to see what was making the loud footsteps. What I saw was something large and hairy with a huge stride in its steps. Walking very quickly like it knew where it was going I would estimate it to be 6 to 7 feet tall. I was freaked out. The other hunter always wears blaze orange when he walks to his spot. I saw he and his son go by my stand that day at 11.30 am.",

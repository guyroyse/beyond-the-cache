  "observed": "Video report filmed by Ron Boles and Larry Newman This report was first made known to Larry Newman and I by this man's daughter. Larry and I went to the residence of the witness which is also the location of the sighting. The witness is a Cherokee Native American elder of this area. He witnessed on a clear summer's day from his front porch, in a field across an old dirt road, a deer running at a very fast pace, with a large grey seemingly bipedal creature in pursuit. The creature was chasing using both arm and legs in a loping movement. Both animals went out of sight but then the witness heard the deer bleating and then a \"Thump\". Then it was quiet.",

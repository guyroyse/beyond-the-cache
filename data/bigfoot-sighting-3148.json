  "observed": "On September 20th, 2001 at approximately 11:30p.m. my wife was returning from Portland to the coast.  She stopped at the rest area on Highway 26 (which I believe is at about the 27 mile marker) to let our dog out. While there she heard what she described as an \"eerie\" scream coming from the southeast and lasting about 4-5 seconds.  She said that it was far enough away that it didn't scare her.As described the scream would have come from across Highway 26 and in an area where there has been some activity (see reports under Clatsop County). I played the recordings on this website for her, and she said it sounded like Matt Moneymaker's Ohio recorded scream.",

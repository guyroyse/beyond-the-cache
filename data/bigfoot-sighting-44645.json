  "observed": "Sighting number #2 was 3/20/2014. This just happened two days ago. I saw what I never thought I would see again, and how different this one was. Me and my friend was coming back from a road trip south when we decided to go down to a place on the Embarras River.  I like to fish and swim at what's called Spencer's Bridge. This used to be a county road that used to lead to a bridge that crossed the river, but the bridge is long and the area floods so much, no one uses it except for people fishing and swimming. I was going really slow because it had just been grated from the last flood. When in front of me I saw a fast dark moving object, it ran on all fours towards the tree line . When it turned south I could see that it was running on all fours as a ape would but fast. It stopped and turned towards us and you could see that it was dual colored, white on one side and brown on other, different yeah. It was too far away to get any more specific on the coloring but this one was much more heavier and hairier. Couldn't really see just how tall he was but his mass was a lot bigger than the last one I seen but that was in the dead of summer He turned and took one last look at us and disappeared into brush. This would of been about 5 miles from where I saw my first one.",

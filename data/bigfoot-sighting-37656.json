  "observed": "Last Thursday,(Thanksgiving), I was heading to Mountaineer casino down route 11 south when I saw a light brown sasquatch cross the other side of the road and leap over a steel barrier into the woods. It was definitely walking upright taking large strides.  It was the middle of the day and sunny and the light brown coat caught my eye.",

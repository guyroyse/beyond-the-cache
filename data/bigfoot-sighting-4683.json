It was VERY quiet. usually we can hear coyotes or owls..this night nothing.  we saw what we thought was a person jogging up the road but realized it had to be at least 7-8 feet tall and was taking huge strides. it was covered with long reddish to blonde  hair and had long arms that swung as it walked.  it looked in neither direction, just straight ahead. it was out of site in about 7-10 seconds and the footfalls could be heard slightly .",

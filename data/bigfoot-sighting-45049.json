  "observed": "My best friend and I were returning from a hunting trip for turkey in eastern WA for my 50th Birthday. With no success further east we went to Teanaway. Again no success, as we returned to the freeway in Cle Elum I was saying to my friend we need to watch for elk and deer as I have seen some bad wrecks on I-90. We spotted one deer when the next thing my friend said \"what is that\". As I approached the area I spotted the movement along the highway and he looked at me and said \"bigfoot\". As we came closer this creature stepped onto the edge of the highway looking dead off into my friend's face as we passed, me braking, I looked into the review side mirror only to see it take two steps onto the highway. I turned to look back at the road ahead so as not to crash, I returned my gaze to my mirrors only to have it gone from the road. It was not a person or a bear, absolutely not. I have never feared going into the woods but will no longer do my 3:30am hunting trips for turkey by myself ever again, let alone camp alone.",

  "observed": "Approximatley 40 yards away standing on the edge of a ravine. Hight difficult to estimate because of standing a little down hill. somewhere around 7ft. Gray hair over entire body. muscular very thick neck. Was standing very erect, turning head side to side as if trying to smell for something. Looked directly at me and I ducked down. When I looked again nothing was there. I heard a scream the previous day but attributed that to a bobcat. A friend of mine was in a deer stand approx. 1 and 1/4 mile away as the crow flies down from the ravine in the direction in which I thought it went. He told me that I wouldn't believe what ran by his deer stand. He described to me the same thing I saw. He was very upset.",

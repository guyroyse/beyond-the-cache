  "observed": "While looking for arrowheads with my  wife and sister-in-law, my wife called me over to  look at this track. The track was in front of a  small cedar tree, approx. 5' tall. I am in the hills  and mountains alot and am familiar with differant  types of tracks, including bear. This was no track I  had ever seen. The track had a similar shape of a human's, but much larger. I wear a 10 1/2 cowboy boot. My foot was approx. the same length as the main portion of the track. The toes extended another 7\" to 9\" past  that.  The track was impressed into the earth approx. 1/2\". I would go on to say that it was anywhere from  8\" to 9\" wide at it's widest spot and 5\" to 6\" at  it's narrowest. The track was the left foot.  The weirdest thing about this  track, was that  it only had three toes. I do not know if this is  common or not, but this one had only three toes. This track was well defined and I would say  made earlier that day. I looked around further and found another track. This one was barely definable, but there the same. It was on the other side of the cedar trees. The stride was approx. 8' long.  I know I probably haven't explained the way the trees were to the foot print, but it was in such away, that it would have had to step over that 5'  cedar tree.",

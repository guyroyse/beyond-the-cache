  "observed": "My wife and I let the dogs out and hung outside watching them. we noticed another dog south of us barking. Our dogs went to the north side of the fenced yard and looked out of the fence for a while, I grabbed them and brought them in the house. I heard a noise north of the house prob. near the creek. I ask my wife if the noise was a coyote since she know them better than I do, she said, \"no, hell no I have never heard that before\" after we got inside I had her listen to a few audio clips, cougars,wolves, and then bigfoot clips on the site (1973,1978) she said that those clips sounded identical. After I told her what clips were played she freaked out and said, \"Shut it off! Doesn't it give you chills.\" She is still freaked out when I play it.....I don't know what it could be but would like to know if it was a bigfoot.",

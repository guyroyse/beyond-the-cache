  "observed": "I was fishing at a set of ponds that back up to a wooded area, not far from Monkey Mountain in Grain Valley. I had been there for about an hour or more, caught a few fish, and threw them back. Tonight was very clear and temperate, a beautiful night actually. I thought I heard a faint noise across a channel between ponds, but not far from me. Jokingly, I grunted. A few moments later, a large rock was thrown into the pond towards me. It scared me so bad I immediately grabbed my things and high tailed it out of there. I am an avid outdoorsman and night fisherman. I know the sounds around lakes, ponds, and woods at night. This was a large rock that had to have been thrown.",

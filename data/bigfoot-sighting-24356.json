  "observed": "A friend and I had decided to go fishing one morning after working the night shift. We arrived at eagle creek around six thirty it was still very dark out but had our lanterns with us. As we stopped the car and got out we walked to the back of the car to get our equipment as soon as my buddy popped the trunk lock we heard a horrible scream and what sounded like someone yelling but the speech was backwards this sent chills down our backs. The sound came from the area we were headed. We waited a few seconds and tried to think of an explanation of the sound but couldn't come up with any thing. We fished  till morning light and then decided to walk the creek edge. We came across a sand bar with a lot of  mussels attached to some shale rocks that protruded up from under the sand as we got closer we saw signs that something had been digging at the mussels at first I thought this could have been any animal doing this but as we got even closer we saw two very detailed foot prints in the sand. There is no doubt in ether of our minds that someone had walked in the sand with bare feet. The prints were approximately 12 to 13 inches what puzzled us was what was someone doing out at six thirty in the morning in early spring with an outside  temp around 35 degrees because we had very heavy clothes on because of the cold and the prints led straight up a four foot embankment and into some very heavy thorn brush the kind that a you can't even walk threw  with out ripping your cloths to shreds. We walked the rest of the creek but couldn't find any other signs or prints.",

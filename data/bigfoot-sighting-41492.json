  "observed": "Hi, my name is xxxxxx, I grew up in Rowley, MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10, I'm now 27, my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said, I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE, tanned brown.. (not brown black, or brown brown, but brown tan) upright creatures, running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don't know if he told anyone ever, but we lost touch over the years, but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown, upright, jogging in a line, and fully unclothed.. I've seen one other unexplained sighting, but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don't know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have.",

  "observed": "Driving home around 3AM returning from my sister's house, I came around the bend on 'B' Street in Aberdeen, after (Stewart?) Park, when I saw a huge upright figure with dark fur. It seemed like it probably had just come from the river side of the road, and didn't seem too concerned that I was driving past.  It was watching me pass the same as I was watching it.  I was in disbelief, and didn't even think to stop, or even wake my then boyfriend. I know this figure wasn't a bear, I know that it wasn't just a huge man in a fur coat.  I do know that what I saw was a Sasquatch. Since it was dark, the only real description I can give is that it was huge, probably around 7', it was mostly upright, with a slight slouch, and the fur looked somewhat matted.",

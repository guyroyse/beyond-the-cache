They reminded me of a situation that my friend Edgar and I experienced one night when we were camping in Cloudcroft New Mexico. It was [1995] in the summer months.  Edgar and I had pitched a tent.  At about 1 in the morning we were awakened by a scream that was coming from far away.  The sound kept getting closer and closer.  We kept trying to figure out what animal was making those noises.  We were too scared to look out so we just stayed very quiet inside the tent.  We could tell that the 'animal' was looking for food because it was making stops at each of the camping spots.  It sounded awful.  It was like a screaming baby or screaming woman.  In between each scream you could also hear some grunts.  Eventually, it reached our caming spot.  We could hear that it was looking around and it left.  It continued the screaming untill it faded in the distance. The following morning we asked the camp manager if he had heard anything during the night.  He said no.  When we told him what we heard, he dismissed it as a cougar.  Since we are not experienced campers, we believed him and left it as that until I herd the recordings on your web page.  The sounds are almost identical to those on the recordings.  The recordings sounds are from far away.  We heard it within a few feet, but they sounded the same.",

  "observed": "Well I was deer hunting with three of my friends I decided to take a break and rest near this clearing. While sitting on a log this tall thing crossed in front of me through the opening in the woods. I was about 120 yards from it and it never looked at me. It walked through the clearing very quickly and was gone. My friends and I had split up. They never saw it and I did not tell many people because I didn't want to be made fun of. After my friend found footprints there this spring I decided it report it.",

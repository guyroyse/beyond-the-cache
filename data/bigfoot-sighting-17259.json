  "observed": "Camping with family in Utah Flaming Gorge National Forest. We we're camping in a very desolate area about 25 miles north of Vernal Utah.  We were in the middle of nowhere. The Road we took off of 191 North was long and unpaved. We camped for 3 days. There was cows grazing on the hills in the distance. My sister and I pitched a tent. My sister and I were annoyed by the constant mooing of the cows & the logging trucks the first night. The second night the cows settled down farely early around 12am and I noticed there was no other noises. In the early am there were no birds chirping or other little chipmunks running around. My sister was still sleeping and I was wide awake when I heard a whooping sound. Twice and very clear. I was trying to think of a bird that made that sound..but I couldn't. After I went on the BFRO website and listened to the whoop recording is when I realized that was exactly what I heard.",

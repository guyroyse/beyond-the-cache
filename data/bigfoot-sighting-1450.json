  "observed": "Driving westbound my brother and I were doing approximately 60 miles per hour on Rte. 224.  Three fire trucks from the Odessa-Montour fire dept. were coming in the opposite direction with lights and sirens on as they were responding to a call. Suddenly, this creature darted across the road from our left to right.  It was illuminated by fire trucks and our headlights.  I yelled to my brother, \"Don't hit that ki-d\". That was when we realized that it was not a human or animal.  We thought the lead fire truck was going to hit it.  We believe it was spooked by the lights and sirens and  panicked.  It ran extremely fast on two legs leaning slightly forward with what we estimated today to be a stride of five to six feet as the road was approximately 30 feet wide. It was completely blackened from head to toe and approximately six to seven feet tall.  It swung it's arms in an ape-like fashion at its sides as if to gain momentum.  Unlike the way a human pumps their arms and fists for speed when running.  That's how we knew it wasn't a person. The creature did not look in either direction as it darted across the road.  It acted like a scared animal.  We returned to the site this morning and did not find any tracks, etc.  Ground was completely hard and dry at the time.  No alcohol involved.",

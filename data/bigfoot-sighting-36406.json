  "observed": "I was sitting at a picnic table eating pizza. I notice four kids running back and forth on a trail. Once they were gone I witnessed what I would call a juvenile sasquatch sneaking down the same trail at approx. 80 yds. The squatch was 3 and a half to 4 tall. It had long brown reddish hair. However it was stocky and I could see dark tanish colored skin threw its hair. Shortly after the kids returned on the trail. The squatch then returned behind them squatted down in the brush and disappeared. I was in total amazement at what I had just seen. ",

  "observed": "I was leaving my cabin heading back from the Pembine area to Green Bay as I rounded a corner and headed south on county road OO.  I saw a figure cross the road.  It walked slowly from East to West as though not in any hurry.  I viewed it from the area just above the elbow up.  It had a pointed head, very broad shoulders, and large biceps.  I could see the arms swing as it walked just as a human would do.  Its color was brown... a mix of dark and light brown with the sun shining off it.  It was not black.  I sped up to get a good look at it and it was gone. I stopped where I saw it cross and looked to the east.  The area was open with scrub brush and it's color would have blended in perfect with the surrounding area.   It was early spring and there were no leaves on the tree.  I could only see to the hills and it would have to have gone 100 to 150 yards down then up to not be seen. I have seen deer, bear, wolves etc in the area and none walk upright.",

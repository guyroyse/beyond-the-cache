  "observed": "Was out on one of my snowmobiles after we already got 3 feet of fresh powder on a boat launch road for Willow Springs Lake on the Mogollon rim above Payson, Az where your team is at right now on 3-8-12 in Payson. I was the first tracks in virgin powder. When I got over a mile & a half or so from the highway a hundred yards or so from the lake I observed foot prints crossing the road deep in the forest heading south. Not snow shoes or boots. At the time I was trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at spaced 4 feet apart in 3 feet of fresh powder. The thought did cross my mind of you know what but I never heard of the Mogollon monster in the 6 years I've been living and snowmobiling here in the Payson area. I know what I saw and only told a handful of friends and family about it. The forest service closes all the forest road gates on December 15th every year and most all the wild life heads south for lower elevations out of the deep snow.",

  "observed": "Dear sirs, On July 04,1987 Saturday evening at about 11: 30  Pm, myself and 2 others had a close-up visual sighting of 2 Bigfoot. I was standing inches away from my friend when we both encountered this. I grew up spending a lot more time in the woods than most of my associates, and I have seen countless bear and cats in the wild. I was never so scared of anything in my life as I was that night.The thing that over-whelmed me was when I shined the flashlight in its face, the eyes were yellow, the exact same color as a deers eyes at night.   That told me that this thing was nocturnal.  I would be forever trying to write everything down that happend that night, so I would like to speak to someone that is highly experienced in this field.   I would greatly appreciate it if you, or someone in this field would call me. Thank you.",

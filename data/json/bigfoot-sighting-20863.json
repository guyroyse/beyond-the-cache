  "observed": "On the morning of August 12, I think I had an experience with a Sasquatch. I was walking up the driveway to the house just after getting the mornings newspaper. Because it happened to be very hot during the day, I laid the newspaper down on the ground to put my hair up. When I looked up after putting my hair up, I saw a big, tan-ish brown creature that had a sort of hump in its back. Its fur was short, and clumped together. It then ran off into the woods. I was frightened, so I ran back to the house. Once inside I heard banging on the trees in the yard. These hangings have been occurring quite frequently now. I've also noticed that wildlife activity in the area is low.",

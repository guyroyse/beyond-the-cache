  "observed": "The place where it happened was on Happy Hollow Road. It was some school function I think we were going to, I don't really remember.  On Happy Hollow Road there were two wooden bridges. The second wooden bridge was over a creek and it was on our way coming out. It would have been the first bridge past our house. As we came around the curve our headlights hit the bridge first and as we swung more around the curve then the headlights shown off the edge of the bridge and onto the creek bank. And that is where the creature was standing. It stood out because it was standing in front of the background of the trees and the brush. As the headlights hit it, then is when you seen the movement, then it turned and looked at us. The headlights hit its eyes and it turned away and we saw it walk off.",

  "observed": "I observed a hairy manlike creature approximately 8 foot tall walking away from me. It had sticks and leaves matted in its thick reddish brown hair. the wind was blowing my way and i smelt a very distinct musky smell. I was very frightened when it stopped and looked in my direction. I had a gun but would never shoot anything unless it is game. I now carry a video camera but have not had an opportunity to observe it again. I observed the creature one other time in 1985 and it is still hard for me to believe what i saw.",

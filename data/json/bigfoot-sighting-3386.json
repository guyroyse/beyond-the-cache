  "observed": "We have 3 dogs: a 100-pound Rottweiler, a 70-pound bird dog (hunting dog), and an 80-pound Shepard-mix. The Rottweiler barks mostly at animals, the bird dog barks at anything making noise, and the Shepard only barks if he hears or sees something too close to the house. These dogs are very close to our house. All three dogs were barking like crazy, carrying on pretty bad. I said to my fiancee, \"what are they barking at, i'd like to get some sleep\". We thought it was deer or coyote. Well, about a minute after that, the dogs got dead quiet, not a peep. So I started to relax. Not a minute after they got quiet, I heard a yell that I have never heard before. It sounded almost like a man with a deep, grumbly voice that was just yelling, \"aaah\". It was loud and the voice got deeper at the very end. Almost like it was mad. Well, it brought chills to me, I asked my fiancee if he heard it, he said he did, but he was half-asleep. I was wide awake. The dogs never made another sound. I know that the noise we heard was not a cat or a dog. I'm not familiar with the sound of a mountain lion, but as the old cliche goes, \"it didn't sound completely human, but it didn't sound completely animal\".",

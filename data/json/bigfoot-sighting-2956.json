  "observed": "While walking uphill about 1/4 mile from Hunter Creek I started to climb over a large fallen tree that was pointed downhill. As I climbed over I noticed, 30 feet away another tree that was also laying on the ground. As I looked, I saw a Bigfoot, stooped over, watching me from behind the trunk. The face was a medium black, with a large brow bone that almost stuck out as far as it's nose. The hair was medium brown with light spots (light reflections?). It's face had darker lines where the skin folded. The face was smaller than one would expect on an animal this size. The eyes were brown and set a little closer than a humans. The nose was flat and wide. I noticed it's lips as being black and thin after it curled it's lip up while he was staring at me. I also noticed the teeth and the lack of any K-9's. It seamed to be around 5 foot tall while stooping over, but could have been around 8 feet when standing erect. After a few seconds it turned and disappeared behind the tree. I went over to area and saw several prints in the forest debris. I followed the prints uphill but soon lost the tracks due to the forest debris.",

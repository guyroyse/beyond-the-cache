  "observed": "It was just at twilight. I was sitting waiting to turkey hunt. I've heard the howls on here but this was different. It sounded higher in pitch all most like a child making the sound. A few minuets later I heard it again. Whatever it was was far off. I was hoping to hear a deeper answer but didn't. At first I thought it was some child calling cows or something, but it was too early for that. I've heard that before.",

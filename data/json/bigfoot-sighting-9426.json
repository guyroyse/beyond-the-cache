  "observed": "In late Sept. 1989, I was deer hunting about 5 miles west of Walkers pass along hwy 178. I had driven a short ways off of the hwy and then walked in about 1/4 mile to a rocky bluff that was at the base of a very large steep mountain (I believe it was Pinion Peak). While sitting there in the dark, I continually had the feeling that I was being watched. I have had this same feeling 2 other times, and in both situations I spotted a Mountain Lion watching me from a distance.  As gray light came, I started glassing the steep dense mountain behind me, looking for whatever it was that was watching me. I really could not see very much as it was still fairly dark and the brush was so thick. I cannot remember how long it was that I was glassing the area when a very loud, booming scream echo’s from the mountain behind me several hundred yards up. It sounded almost like a terrified woman screaming as loud as she could. At first, I thought that someone was playing a hoax on me. The more I looked at how steep that mountain was, the time of day (early morning because I only had gray light), and how dense it is up there, the more uneasy I became. I left the area immediately.",

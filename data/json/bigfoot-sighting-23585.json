SO I TURNED ON THE TV,  I KEPT HEARING THIS NOISE OUT SIDE LIKE A HEAVY BREATHING, SOMETHING KEPT HITTING THE WALL NOT VERY HARD BUT LOUD ENOUGH TO HEAR! I LAID THERE AND KEPT QUIET!  OUR DOG WHO IS LOCKED ON THE PORCH KEPT GROWLING FROM HIS DOG HOUSE.  I LOOKED AT THE TIME AND IT WAS ABOUT 2:30 AM.  I HAD A ERRIE FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS LOOKING AT ME THROUGH THE WINDOW BUT LAID THERE QUITE. I COULD SEE A DARK FIGURE STANDING AT THE WINDOW.  I TURNED UP THE TV TO SCARE IT BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.  I CALLED MY BROTHER AND HE SAID HE WOULD LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE!",

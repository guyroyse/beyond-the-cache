  "observed": "My incident was no visual in the sense of seeing bigfoot itself.  another family member of mine has seen him before.  So it has been common in the area.  My incident however was simply footprints in the snow.  I saw the footprints in the snow in the morning.  We had snow the night before.  The footprints started around a tree in front of our house.  I followed them and they led around the back of our house to another tree.  The footprints then circled around the area in front of the tree about 4 full circles and then stopped.  There were no footsteps leading from the circle to anywhere else, as well as no footsteps back to the front of the house.  I put a garbage can lid over one of the prints to preserve it until I could take a picture of it.  Unfortunately I never had a chance.",

I came around corner it was standing on left side of road. It immediately turned its face away from me and was standing there. As I got behind it, it was between nine and ten foot tall and three foot wide at shoulders. Its fur was the same color as the dirt road it was on. I drove past it and was as close as 6 foot to it. It kept its face turned away from me the whole time. I drove away in disbelief and shock.",

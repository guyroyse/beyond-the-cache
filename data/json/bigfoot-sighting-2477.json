  "observed": "This is the second time I have listed this report.  Two men Lawyer Henry and another fellow were quail hunting along a fence line near the Trinity River (A swamp, tall old oak, hickory and pecan.)  They saw a very large 9' tall brown/black creature burst from the very thick brush carrying a calf.  The calf weighed approx 300lbs and this animal had it in its arms running upright.  Needless to say they departed the area and sped back to their employer a MR. JW who would like to remain confedential due to his failing health.  As dusk approached MR JW, Sherrif, and the hunters returned to the location to find; one dead calf, entrails removed and brush busted up all around.  The three dogs MR JW brought would not get out of the car and the concenious opinion was to leave. Not long after this occured MR Lawyer Henry, his family and many neighbors left the area.  A couple of their house still stand, although in severe disrepair and grown up with brush.  The area is still remote and on private land.",

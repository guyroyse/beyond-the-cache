  "observed": "We was walking through the woods in Tuskegee, Alabama in the Tuskegee National Forest going duck hunting, while we were walking we stopped for a quick minute to rest and i looked up and seen something flash before my eyes, as we got to our destination at the swamp. We looked to our left and saw something walking accross the beaver dam. We do not believe it acknowledged our prescence. We would describe it as a tall, wide, black from head to toe creature walking upright on two legs trying to quickly get in to the woods. Also looked like as if he were carring a large object in one hand. It was time to go after that. The hunt was over.",

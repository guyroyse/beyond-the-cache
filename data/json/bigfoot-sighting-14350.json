  "observed": "As I was leaving my house and turned out onto the street,  movement caught my eye so I turned to see what it was.  Less than a football field away from me I could see something that immediately I knew was not a man and not a bear.  I could see what I will call a bigfoot walking north towards the water. We live near the water in Puget Sound.  It appeared to be slumped forward to some degree ... I guestimated it was 6 1/2 feet tall, but upon walking to that area later, I realized it must have been closer to 8 feet tall to be visible from where I saw it from my car.  It seemd to have long hair that was brown, like a brown crayon.  The face was mostly hairy but seemed to have shorter hair around the facial features.  The nose was more pushed in and flat than protuding, but the nostrils were turned up some.  It still looked more human than it did ape-ish. It was talking big steps and appeared to look in my direction but did not appear startled by my presence.  The hair looked messy and ungroomed. It seemed like forever but I figure I only saw him for about 10-13 seconds. When this happened our neighbors had been logging for the previous 2 days in a large area nearby, 4 acres.  There was lots of commotion and noise. It may have been trying to avoid the noise or to come check it out. Im told it was a weird time of day to see one, but I saw what I saw...",

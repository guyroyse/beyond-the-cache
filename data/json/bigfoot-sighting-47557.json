  "observed": "At 4:30 am my wife woke up hearing a sound that could be described as tree knocking. Seven knocks, she then woke me up but I did not hear the noise. The next day I researched tree knocking and found your website. This made me think about 2 other incidents. In the summer of 2013 we heard a loud growl in the woods and I thought it may be a bear even though no bears have been seen in the area. The other incident happened while we were sleeping and I was awakened by a smell that drifted in the bedroom window. I thought it was a skunk odor but my wife disagreed, it was like no skunk we ever smelled before. The other incident reported on your website was on East Fouch Rd and that's where we live. So now I believe our 2013 incidents could have been a bigfoot.",

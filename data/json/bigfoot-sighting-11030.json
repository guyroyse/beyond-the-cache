  "observed": "Two friends of mine and myself were pushing a cave lead in Cornfield Sink on the east side of Pigeon Mountain. We came out of the lead at about 3:00AM and started gathering our caving gear together for the 1/2 mile walk to the car. As we are about to leave the strangest call I have ever heard came from the opposite side of the sink from us. Distance would have been about 900'. The three of us have been woodsmen all our lives but none of us had ever heard a call like that. It sounded like four different animals in one. All powered by what must have been an enormous set of lungs! Hearing the vocalization the three of us looked at each other saucer eyed not saying a word. Each of us was hoping the others would pipe up with a logical explanation for what we had heard. Needless to say since we had been planning to leave anyway we beat a hasty retreat to the vehicles.",

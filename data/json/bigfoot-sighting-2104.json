  "observed": "I was driving around the backroads of fouke and the jonesville area, it was a saturday late evening just before dark. I was looking over all the damaged trees that were still down from the Ice storm we had in this area during christmas.As I came near boggy creek it was getting somewhat dark, so I decited to turn around and head back home. I pulled into a dirt drive in front of a hunting lease to turn around and suddenly I heard a Howling sound like I never heard before. It was then dark to where I could not see threw the trees anymore so I decited to get home. Later on I was able to listen to some sound recordings of bigfoot and just as I thought, I got a rare chance to hear the real thing.",

Stewart Ga we were conducting wargames my squad was moving through the woods when we started to hear a very low growl then a hi pitched scream as soon as we came out of the woodline to the south of my squad we saw what we thought was an an opposing force we were about 250 feet from the animal so be again to close in on it we called out twice to it and again we heard the growl it then stood up and we realized that it wasn't human it was between 7 and 8 foot tall and realizing that we were in danger we began to back away at this point it began throw rocks toward us and then took off there was about 300ft between it and the wood line and it took it about 20 seconds to make the distance the rest of the night we heard strange sounds from the woodline from what thought was multiple creatures",

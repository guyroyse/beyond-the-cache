  "observed": "On the opening day of antlered deer season in 1982, my father, a family friend, and myself encountered a strange figure walking towards us in the pre-dawn woods.  This occured in state forest land in North-Central Pennsylvania. There was about 1/2 foot of snow on the ground, but the temperature had risen all night, leading to fog and drizzle by dawn.  We had just walked about half a mile down a logging road towards our spot.  We were catching our breath before ascending a steep hill when we noticed a hulky figure approaching, walking upright through some fallen timber that covered a beaver swamp in that area. This figure was dark in color (no red or orange hunting clothes), carried no visible equipment (including a flashlight--its ability to navigate through the terrain in the dark was an immediate signal to us that something out of the ordinary was going on here), and did not answer our attempts to communicate. It stopped about 50 feet away from us, looked in our direction, than headed back from where it had come.  Our reaction at the time was that this was probably the dumbest hunter we had ever seen, but in later years (especially with some reports of Bigfoot sightings coming from PA) we wonder who or what it was.  There is no doubt for any of us that this was not a bear.",

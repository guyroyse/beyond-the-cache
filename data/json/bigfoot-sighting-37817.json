  "observed": "Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn't see anything. We didn't think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows. This is very exciting!",

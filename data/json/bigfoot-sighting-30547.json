  "observed": "I was leaving a hunting camp and just drove on to the main dirt road and picking up speed and I just came over a small hill and I was looking ahead of me and as always looking for deer or a bear crossing the road. In front of me crossing the road was bigfoot it stopped just off center on the road. I hit the binders, it froze and stood there for just a moment. Turned and went back into the timber line. Of course my camera was in the back seat, my cell phone had no signal. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared. I should have drove up to the spot and tracked it into the timber but I didn't. I not told this story to to many people because they wouldn't believe me",

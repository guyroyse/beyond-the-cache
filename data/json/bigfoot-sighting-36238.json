  "observed": "Last night, late around 1:45a.m. I wasn't sleeping well.. felt a little indigestion.. came downstairs to get some antacids.. Sat down in the living room to watch a few minutes of TV to wait for the medicine to work. Around 2 am.. a very loud scream/roar sounded out that startled me right up off the sofa. The roar lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. The sound had a deep chested sound.. like something large. I listened and heard no other noises.. no other animals.. no thumping.. no running.. nothing but silence. Sound did not sound like a person. Did not sound like a dog growling..did not sound like a coyote.. did not sound feline... I approached the front window and looked out through the blinds. Whatever it was sounded close. I would guess it was less than 30 feet from the front porch. The porch light was on. As was the streetlight. I live in a populated city neighborhood with multiple houses around me. Nobody else has come forward to say they heard the same. Location in Dallas but bordering Acworth.. Paulding/Cobb county.",

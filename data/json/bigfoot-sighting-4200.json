  "observed": "While driving south down Austin Road between Maple Street and State Route 84, a mother and son had just passed the \"Welcome to Geneva, Ohio\" sign.  All of a sudden, from the right side of the road a very large hair covered animal walked across the road in plain view of there headlights.  They could see it from the neck down and estimated it was no more than 150 feet away.  Both witness's said they could see its left arm swinging as it walked and it took only 2 1/2 steps to cross the road She said it was dark in color while he thought it more closer to be dark brown.  Estimated height was 8 feet tall and the creature appeared very ‘Bulky' from the side view.  Other than her husband, Catherine has never told anyone in fear of ridicule.  She contacted me via Ray Crowe, Don Keating and the Internet.  They thought they were the only two people ever to see a Bigfoot in Ohio so they kept it very quiet. (Investigators note: It took me almost 9 steps to cross the road at the same location) Report published in the December, 1998 issue of the Monthly Bigfoot Report.",

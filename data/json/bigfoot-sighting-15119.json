  "observed": "I was walking our puppy at 2:30 Am, Puppy training! We live directly across from Camp Atterbury,which is heavily wooded on our side.  We also share it with Brown County State park And Yellow wood. I was basically star gazing... I hear a loud howl type sound, that I have never heard before; I grew up here, so I know what coyotyes, wolves, foxes, owls, and even bobcats sound like...THIS WAS NOT ANY OF THOSE! I have never heard this sound from here???? There was one short howl... it sounded like it was right in front of me no more than 140 ft. I moved a few paces to my right and again I heard a howl in front of me, as if it moved to the right with me...this time after the second howl there was about four or five short hoops after it! By that time I was really freaked out and ran back to my house!",

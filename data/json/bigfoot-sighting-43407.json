  "observed": "Driving  east on SR 32 in Pike County Ohio noticed a dark figure on the white center line of a four lane highway. It took approx. 4 steps and was off the shoulder, I initially thought it was a person crossing the road at an intersection I proceeded to the point where it crossed the road but no intersection. I mentioned it to my wife and although she did not see it we got to the point where it crossed and no person or animal in sight. There was a light dusting of snow at the time we did not stop to look for for prints as we were in a hurry being it was Christmas Eve.",

  "observed": "Just after dark I decided to go to the park for some night fishing. Pulled over before I got to the lake to urinate. I stepped just into the woods and began to take care of business. I then heard something walking through the woods towards me. I could hear the leaves crushing as it came my way as if it was walking with heavy steps. I decided it would be a good idea to get out of there so I started back for my truck. Then the noise became louder, like jogging or running. I ran, jumped in my truck and began driving. I watched my rearview mirror and all I could see was something big and dark standing on two legs come into the road behind me. I wasn't about to stop and see for sure what it was.",

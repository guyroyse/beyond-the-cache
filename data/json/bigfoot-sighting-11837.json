  "observed": "We were at Lake Tahoe the first week of may this year - 2005.  While walking on the beach looking for pretty stones, my friend noticed this print in the beach gravel.  What really caught our eye was the depth of the print (3 inches) and how the stones on the bottom had been incredibly compressed as if done by a great weight.  Other prints were visible, but not as good as this one. We were south of Tahoe City, and north of Sugar Pine Campground.",

  "observed": "I was driving along Route 6 crossing the CT state line into RI.  The road is very dark and heavily wooded in this particular area.  As I was traveling east, something quickly moved across the road in front of me.  I was driving approximately 55 mph.  Once I registered what I was seeing I also realized that whatever it was, it had walked on two legs.  It cleared the guardrail on the side of the road in one step and was gone.  I was very spooked.  The whole incident lasted less than 30 seconds, though I think about it often., especially when I drive through that area.",

  "observed": "This is a reoccurring situation. I have seen prints that looked like giant bare feet in the dirt. It was in the winter time and i know there would be no one walking up the side of a mountain barefoot in those kinds of temperatures.  I noticed i have found them along service roads and along trails by power lines. I suspect they are found there for the same reason i am there. Deer hunting. There are also three lakes and multiple creeks in the same area. I was hunting with my wife and i showed her prints and she wanted to leave real quick. I have seen an actual animal when i was in my teens but i lived in Ohio then. People say that I'm crazy but i know these animals are real. The closest thing that i can compare them to are giant orangutangs. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but i know the woods and every animal that lives there. I know what these are and that they are real. I live in Rome, Georgia  and where i find these tracks are near to where i live but i don't tell anyone because of the fear some yahoo would try to hunt them.",

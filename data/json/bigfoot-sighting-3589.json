  "observed": "In 1998 I was told about bigfoot being spotted in Woodbury gameland. So I have been studying the area since then. The very first time out there, I found a three toed foot print about 14 inches long and about 6 inches wide. At another time out there I found a tree along a dirt road that had a top branch broken and twisted at the same time. This break occured at 8 feet above the ground. A person could not have done this because the top of the tree would not have been able to support any kind of weight due to the smallness of the branches. That same day about a mile away in a field I found all types of bones spread about in a 20 foot diameter. The strangest thing that I found though was that two freshly killed beaver remains were stacked on top of each other like something ate one, then ate the other one and placed it on top of the first one tail on top of tail, bones on top of bones in the same directions.I still search this area at this time trying to get evidence that sasquatch is alive and well.",

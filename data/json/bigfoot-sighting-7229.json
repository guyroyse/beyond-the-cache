  "observed": "It was in mid-late April 1994 when my 7 year old son and I went to find a fishing lake we had heard about in the mountains north of Gold Bar.  Being a new residence to Washington at the time I had no knowledge of any ape-like creatures in the woods.  I can remember it was an early Wednesday morning and heavy overcast with snow still clinging to the shaded areas. We ended up first on a black-top road which gave way to gravel that became extremely narrow and twisting as we climbed higher into the mountains. With my son grumbling and my dog needing to lift a leg along with me being not sure we were even on the right road I decided to turn around and go back to let him drop his line in a stream we passed by. Parking the car we proceed to walk a ways downstream some 150-200 yards.  With our dog out ahead I had my hands full half carrying my son and equipment through the brush.  It was when stream made a sharp turn that I first caught wind of a foul smell, a bad odor which is hard to explain.  At about the same moment our dog came whimpering back all nervous acting and hanging under my feet. I looked in the direction which the dog just came and by my estimates no more than 30-35 yards away was \"something\" hunched down and apparently ripping apart the carcus of an animal. It was hairy and extremely large.  Upon seeing us it rose and looked right at us.  It did not show fear and for the life of me I don't remember seeing its eyes, yet my son who was starting to cry kept saying \"look at its eyes\".  Dropping everything except my son I made a hasty retreat back towards the car.  We could not have made more than 20 feet when it let out a scream that to this day still sends chills through me.  I have never heard anything or want to hear anything like it again.  I have never been one to get overly jarred about things but that encounter unnerved me.  I thought for sure we were going to be attacked.  It made several of these screams and once atop a little ridge I looked back and could still see it standing there near the water.  Except to my wife, I have never told this story to any one.  Needless to say we never again went fishing in Washington",

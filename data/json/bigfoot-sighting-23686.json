  "observed": "The incident all started at our house in Cedar Springs, MO. we were burning trash in our trash barrel and playing our harmonicas. we then decided to race around the poll barn about 100 yards away. we then moved our way to the side of the car parked about 5 yards to the left of the trash barrell.  i decided to spout a few notes off my harmonica to start the race. once finished we both layed down our mouth harps and got ready to run the two of us took about 2 - 3 paces and both stopped dead in our track not saying or looking at each other we both turned and ran. what we both noted that we saw was something that was very tall and broad. it stopped and looked at us as we ran towards it and I believe that is what startled us the most is that no animal would just stand as two humans ran towards it.",

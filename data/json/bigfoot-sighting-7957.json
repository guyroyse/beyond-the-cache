  "observed": "My partner and myself were elk hunting in the \"Saddle Mountain Unit.\" It was approximately one hour after daylight. We were standing near our vehicle on a pullout off an old logging road trying to spot elk. I then heard a loud wailing scream tapering off into an agonizing moan. My partner just stood there looking into the canyon.I didn't speak to him. After another couple minutes passed, the scream occured again. I knew that he had heard it both times. I asked him what he thought it was. He asked what I thought it was. I told him that we both know it's a sasquatch. The sound was very loud. If I were to guess it was 250-300 yards away. Over the next ten minutes, the scream occured 2-3 more times. It seemed that the sound was directed to different directions the last couple screams. My hair was sticking up and it quite literally scared the hell out of me. No more screams were heard.(more to story)",

  "observed": "It was about 4:00 am on April 3, 2014 I was driving to work south on Route 11 towards Woodstock, VA. I saw a tall dark figure move from the east side of the edge of road and go into the brush down into the stream area at Artz road. I estimated its height to be over 7 1/2 feet tall because of a stop sign that it was standing next to and in 2 large bounds it cleared the road and was in the stream area. I have heard of reports of tree knocks and growls in this area for the past couple of years. And since my sighting my wife and I have even smelled wet animal sulfur smell coming near our home in Toms Brook, VA just 3 miles from my sighting several nights over the past couple months. Our dogs refuse to go near the edge of our property at night when we take them out before we go to bed too.",

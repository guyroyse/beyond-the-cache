  "observed": "Me and a friend were camping on an island on the St. Croix River. Late at night we heard a lot of stange noises. We light firecrackers and the noises persisted all night into the morning. Then at about 8:00 A.M. the noises stopped and then we heard something large run on the opposing island. I went to investigate and somthing stank very bad. After walking around the island that we were staying on we saw many tracks some measuring up to 17-18 in. We also found a small pile of Clam shells and a large indented area next to them that were not there earlier that day.",

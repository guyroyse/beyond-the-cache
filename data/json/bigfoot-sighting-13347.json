  "observed": "I was about 12 years old at the time. My brother and I spent the summer helping my Uncle build a house in Meridian , Mississippi. We were there for a month or so when I had an encounter. I had gone into the woods some distance (one half mile?) from the home with a BB gun. I was by myself at the time and remember seeing something moving very quickly (as if on a dirtbike or motorcycle) crossing me at an angle to my left. I remember thinking the rider was wearing a  brown helmet and brown leather coat watching it jump and moving very fast through the thick forest. As I watched I realized there was no sound from an engine, only the sound of snapping sticks as it went by. I was terrified at the idea that I had seen a bigfoot or whatever and ran back to the house and never spoke of it to anyone (at the time).",

  "observed": "I currently have a job as a test driver and i spend a lot of time driving on alligator alley (I-75 between Naples and Ft. Lauderdale) and on many of the other roads out in the everglades. One about 2 weeks ago I was driving east along alligator alley when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye. Off to the right side of the road I saw what appeared to be a hairy animal standing about 6 ft. tall, it appeared to be standing in a clearing about 20 ft. south of the canal that follows the roadway. Although it was only a quick sighting I am pretty confident in what I saw, later that day when driving by the same spot I tried to see if there was anything static in the clearing that could be mistaken for a creature and I couldn't find anything.",

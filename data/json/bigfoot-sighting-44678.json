  "observed": "I was driving to work this morning on a long stretch of road (CR 32) 20 miles from Jasper, Texas and saw in a distance a black object I thought to be a wide or 2 seat ATV on the road.  This is not unusual so I did not think much about it.  As I got closer it went to the side of the road (not unusual for ATVs either).  I slowed down because I was approaching what I thought was the ATV and it went into the ditch. As I approached a big black thing stood up lifted up his leg and crossed a log, going into the forest. It had been bent over until I got close to it, I guess. I can not explain what it was. When it crossed the log it disappeared into the forest. I know exactly where it crossed and I have asked my husband to go and look for foot prints. I have never believed in Big Foot but I can tell you this is not anything I have ever seen in my 53 years of life! When I got to work this morning I shared what I had seen with co-workers.  One of them suggested I write you and gave me your website information.",

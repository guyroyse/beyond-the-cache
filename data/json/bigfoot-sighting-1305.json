  "observed": "We were driving north about a mile or two from my moms house in the back roads of Stecker , driving about 40 miles an hour (we were taking my sister back home who lives about 8 miles away)when all of a sudden we saw what looked like a grayish looking football player streak across the road. It was very fast when it ran across the road. I know it wasnt no deer because whatever it was, it was on two legs,grayish, and was built like a football player. Meaning it was thick on top like it had shoulder pads on. I never seen an object like that ever. I cant exactly say what I saw but all I know is that I saw somthing weird. If it was a bigfoot, in my opinion from this happening of why they are so hard for people to prove is because they are so incredibelly fast. Maybe thats why their so hard to prove or get a hold of. All I know they are extremly fast. We didnt stop or nothing we were to scared so we just kept driving . We were in a little bity car, a 79 old Datsun, so I know I couldnt run over it or somthing. ",

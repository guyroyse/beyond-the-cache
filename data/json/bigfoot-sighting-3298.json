  "observed": " It was about 6 am on my way to work at [R****  Ranch] when something came from the right side of the road, out of the woods, and forced me to stop or run into it. It is dark that time of morning so it took a few seconds to get my thoughts together. When I did I couldn believe what I was seeing.\"IT\" was somewhere between 7-8 feet tall (at least)with white or light gray hair from head to toe. \"IT\" was standing 10-12 feet in front of my car directly in the head lights so I had a perfect view. The creature was standing facing the left side of the road with a slight left twist to it's body in my direction. We stared at each other for what seemed to be minutes but I can't say for sure how long it actually was. I had absolutely no fear of this creature, it seemed to have a sad demeaner. This creature made no sound at all ( like the screams I've heard about) I do not have any reason to believe it was a male or female. Needless to say I have carried my camera  every since but I believe that it was a once in a life time incident.",

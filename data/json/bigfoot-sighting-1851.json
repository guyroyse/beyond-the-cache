  "observed": "Yesterday up the road from my house a friend and I actually saw a bigfoot in the daylight about 6 pm.  As i stated on the 99 incident at my home this must be a route they use after what we saw yesterday.  We are going to go look for prints today. We we driving down the street and at the top of the hill I saw something dart past a telephone pole on my right.  It was very fast and my first reaction was that its a jogger dressed in black, just like in 1973 and I said nothing but as we got to the intersection my friend says \"where'd he go\" and I said \" did you see something dart up in the woods?\"  He said yes.  We turned around right then and there and went to look in the woods.  There was nothing there.  Nothing moves at that speed.  By the way we live just west of Alliance Ohio where there have been sightings.  Maybe this is a route they use?? Thing was all black and had a long torso with very tall long arms that were swinging in a forward motion when it was running.",

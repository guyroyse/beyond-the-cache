  "observed": "I was standing on the frog effigy in Buffalo Rock State Park in Utica Illinois. I saw and heard the same big foot everybody else describes moving very fast and easily on the side of the steep embankment below the effigy toward the river. It made a crashing sound in the brush. I did not smell it or see its face. I only heard it and saw it from the side and back.",

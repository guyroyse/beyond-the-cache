  "observed": "My sister, one late night was coming from work in Geneva, Alabama.  She was passing thur another rural community not far from our home, in Holmes Co. Fl. She said she saw something ahead of her about 300 feet big and hairy standing near the road and the closer she got it moved away from the highway into the woods. She slowed down to see if it was a man, of course it wasn't and she thought from a far, it had on a light green arm jacket with long hair, flowing over it, but it wasn't a arm jacket at all. But it was covered in hair. stood over 6 to 7 feet tall. She needless to say, made sure she chose a different way home to avoid another encounter or never break down.",

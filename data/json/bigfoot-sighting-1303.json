  "observed": "My mother and her sister were going to get the cows from the pasture to bring them to the barn. They had just gone through a shelter belt of trees into a clearing when they heard rustling like something moving in the trees. Thinking it was one of the cows they turned around and saw a very tall, hairy creature running away from them. It was standing completely upright running on two legs. Needless to say they ran the other direction.",

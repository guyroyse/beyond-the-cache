  "observed": "I and my former wife encountered three unusual events in a two year period, twice on horseback. The first was a series of foot prints ( one very clear that we photographed), on a trail near the Bar-717 ranch east of Hyampom.It was about 17 inch. long and 7 inch. wide. Next was a sound heard at night when we worked for the Manzanita ranch west of Hyampom at about 11:30 at night. It woke us up and was an incredibly loud screaming that is hard to discribe. Never heard such a vocalization before or since. (Third is detailed in another report.)",

  "observed": "I believe it was 1976 when I and a couple of cousins (primos), were deer hunting in Otero county between the area of Weed and Pinon, New Mexico in Otero county. I am a loner by nature, so I  went off to do my own hunting. They went a different direction. As I climed the side of a mountain side I spotted some turkeys running up hill, so I gave chase so to speak. As I got to the top, I started going down the other side, it was very thick with pinon trees. As I went further down I saw a small meadow in the arroyo.  I was on my knees because of all the thick trees. Anyway as I sat there, tired of walking, I was looking towards the meadow, and from the left side of the meadow I saw something walk out from the tree line, and up the edge, and back into the tree line. It never saw me and I did not stick around for it to see me. What I saw was tall, maybe six and a half to seven feet tall, black long hair all over its body, and walked like a man. It was heavy set and appeared muscular. Its face was also covered with hair. I did not tell anybody about it until a few years ago, when I mentioned it to my grand kids. They laugh about it, so I do not tell it anymore.  But I know what I saw and I would not shoot at it if ever I see another one.  I had a 300 B.D.L. Remington with me at the time, but I didn't even rasied my gun at it.",

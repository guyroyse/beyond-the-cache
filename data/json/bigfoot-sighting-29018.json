  "observed": "I was driving home with my oldest son from grocery shopping.  As we were approaching our house down the street , something crossed the roadway  about 30 feet in front of us it had dark fur I would say it only took 3 steps to cross the 2 lane road, it walked on 2 legs and had considerably long arms, I was set back for a moment we do have bears up by us but this distinctly was walking on 2 long legs, definetly taller than my suv. This was seen at dusk our road is about2 miles long fairly secluded farms heavily wooded areas various ponds/streams. It entered into the wooded area that runs between me and neighbors. as I pulled into my driveway aboout 200 feet back from road as we got out of the car their was an awful dead animal smell like rotted skunk and we heard breaking twigsand a sound like \"woot woot\"  got spooked went into house.  Went outside an hour later to get last grocery bag I forgot  smell was completely gone. I never told anybody except my husband, I didnt want people to think I was crazy,  i am a mother of 5 beautiful children and this was an experience I will not forget.",

  "observed": "I was driving back from work late on Tuesday the 25th of February and I'll never forget what I saw. As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn't have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven't been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw. I've been looking online for another explanation, but I can't find anything.",

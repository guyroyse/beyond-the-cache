  "observed": " The ground was real hard. We found a total of maybe 20 tracks. There is a factory that produces pork rinds in the area and you could smell this all around this area.  This is a gravel road leading back to the open fields.and woods, and you also cross another creek. There are a total of 4 diffrent sections of woods but the tracks came out of the larger woods that the creek bed was in. Large foot prints about 18\" long and 6-7\" wide about 3-4\" deep and also small juvenile prints around 11-12\". 4\" wide about 1 1/2 depth stride around 4-4.5'. The pictures were taken and submited to the BFRO.  Prints were found in the open field, where the larger prints joined up with the smaller foot prints, then the prints traveled togather. Then it got to the gravel rd. and I could only presume that they were headed for another section of woods across another field  The stride between each track was 6-7 ft. All the measurements are estimates only for I didn't have a rule, only a camera.",

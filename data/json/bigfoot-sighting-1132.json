  "observed": "The sighting was related to me by my father.(the witness) A large Bigfoot type creature was seen in field. My father was driving to work on a county road when he noticed a large dark shape in a hayfield/pasture. There was no livestock in the field at that time and thats what made him notice the dark figure. As he got closer he noticed it was human shaped, between 7 and 9 ft. tall and covered with black hair! The creature soon noticed the vehicle and made its way to the cover of a nearby creek.(Coon Creek) It moved quickly but didnt seem to be paniced. Both my father and I returned to the spot shortly after to look for clues but nothing was found. We told the property owner we wanted to get some sand from the creek. If he only knew! At his closest point he was maybe 100 yards from the creature.",

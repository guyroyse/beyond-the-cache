  "observed": "While during some yard chores, we noticed a series of tracks going into the hollow on our property. Upon examination, we realized these were very large barefoot human like tracks. They were close to 13 inches long and over 6 inches wide at the toes. They were leading into some thickets so we decided not to follow. What impressed us more than anything was the stride between the tracks. The stride was at least 4 1/2 to 5 feet long. Being very familiar with bears, we knew these were not bear tracks because of the enormous size, lack of claws, and human like shape. The game warden came out the next day to view the tracks. He had no idea what could have made the tracks. Especially anything native to Ohio. To this day, we have no clue what could have made those tracks!",

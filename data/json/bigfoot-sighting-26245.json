  "observed": "I was awakened by a strong odor.When I opened my eyes I saw a huge creature only 3 feet away looking down at me from just outside my bedroom window.My bed was directly under and against the window,so I was looking up and this thing blotted out most of my view.I ran to my parents room as this thing let out what I can only describe as a mix of a roar and a scream.This woke my mother,sister,a dog inside and a dog out on our porch.The dog outside was barking and growling as I grabbed a .44 revolver. I was going to go out and bring in the dog when the creature roared again.Then the dog started whining.My mother said not to go out and suddenly my .44 didnt seem big enough to do any good. We spent the rest of the night terrified.",

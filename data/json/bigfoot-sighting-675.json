  "observed": "I was deer hunting on the east slope of a very steep hillside & saw movement about 70 yards down & away from me.  I started to bring my rifle up but realized it was too dark & tall to be a deer.  I saw this \"thing\" walk through the trees & even though it was very dry & crunchy in the woods it made no sound.  I saw it walk very briskly for about 40 yards and then turned down the slope & out of sight.",

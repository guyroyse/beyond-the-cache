  "observed": "My family was on vacation in Colorado Springs, Co, last summer. We were driving up Pike's Peak on the main road, and turned off onto the first rest area parking lot. The region was composed of large and small rock formations and was forested, primarily with pine trees. A stream was across the street. It is an area that is not inhabited by human, except for the traffic on the road: tourists visiting Pike's Peak. I was standing on top of a large rock formation, looking down on my dad, who was about to take my picture with his camera. I shouted, \"Dad, look!\" as I saw what I immediately believed to be a bigfoot 100 feet behind him. My dad did not turn around and look at the bigfoot, because he wanted to take my picture. The bigfoot was in motion, black, and was quickly out of sight. I know what bears look like, because I did a report for school on bears last year. This was not a bear.",

  "observed": "It was 1250 am labor day. Was on the way home fishing with two buddies.I was taking one home when he said what is that a big dog up ahead.There was a trash can up ahead and something was trying to hide behind it but was too big. I go fifteen feet from the trash can and it stood up.I never in my life was i prepared for what i saw,We all looked at it and i pulled in real fast and it took off in front of my head lights ten foot from us.It had long hair about 5 or six inches long and turned and looked at us twice to see if we were on his tail i guess.This was a face to face incounter with this thing. He had his head in a trash can eating something.Thats how we got so close he didn't see us comeing. He left a foot print behind and the police took a picture of it.What really sucks is no one really take us seriously on this,We all three know what we saw.We was fifteen feet at the most from it the whole time chaseing it with my truck,It ran behind a building where i couldn't drive.I went and looked in the trash can to see what he was eating.There was some trash some one threw in there that had some mcdonalds.cupcakes and a chocolate milk container in it.The bank is right across the street from where we spotted the thing.I know that theres a good chance they might have it on one of their cameras.Theres a bunch of cameras pointing all over the bank if theres footage its some good stuff.",

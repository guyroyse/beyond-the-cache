  "observed": "We saw footprints while walking in the woods that must have been 20 inches long and found some tree branches broken down. They were originally about 15 feet high. We decided to head back to his house right away because we both felt as if we were being watched and it was close to dark. The entire way home we felt as if we were being followed. Then the next morning I awoke to see a large creature about 20 feet from the house (I slept on the fold out couch and the entire front of the house has windows.) It must have been at least 10 feet tall as the windows are 15 feet off the ground and it was no more than 5 feet below me. It wandered around for a while and I did not dare move. It was Brown and looked very human except for its size and forehead and obviously the hair. After about five minutes it walked toward the house and up a bank. As it passed the house it banged on the wall and I thought it's arm would come right through.My friend was wakened by this and came in and I told him what I had seen.We decided not to go back out to follow the tracks.",

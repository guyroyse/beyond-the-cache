  "observed": "I was playing in the woods outside of the town of Jefferson when a group of us heard some strange noises in the woods. When we investigated to see if it was the other members of our group, we saw a large hairy creature moving away from us rapidly. We first thought it was a bear, but it was not shaped like a bear and could run upright. We all ran home at that moment and never saw nor heard anything like it again.",

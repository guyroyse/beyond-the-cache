  "observed": "Two creatures. . .walked upright.  Hairy from head to toe.  One on the east side of the road in the woods, the other in the field on the west side of the road.  I was eight years old and in Cub Scouts.  Five other boys and I were fishing near a house on Rolland Road, 12 miles west of Mt. Pleasant.  A crash of a broken log alerted us to the one in the east.  It was a largre dark figure, crouching in the woods.  We ran like h*ll to the house and when we came out an hour later is when we saw the other in the field.  We knew it was another one because it was lighter in color and you could still hear crashing in the woods.  It walked strange, with the momentum of it's whole body.  It was a long time before I'd go back down that road.  Not until I was sixteen would I ride my bike along there.",

  "observed": "This past Sunday, 5/23/04 at 10:30 am, we found strange foot prints in the muddy parts in the road along Murry Range, Covelo CA. The print did not resemble bear tracks. These tracks where longer and had no claw imprints in the mud. After taking pictures of several different foot prints with a tape measurer, we started to look around for other sign. We did not see any thing but more foot prints and a smaller version of the foot print.",

  "observed": "Rode my bike to the Audobon Wildlife Area. I was 10, 11 years old, i guess. As i entered, i saw a strange man walking south toward the road, Pioneer trail. Maybe 50 (?) yards from me; do not remember seeing lower half of body. After a short while, i realized this was not a man. I remember reddish (hair) appearance. Became very frightened & left quickly. Do not remember any other details about this animal's appearance. Had no idea of what i saw at the time. Bigfoot was an unknown concept. In fact, never associated the experience with Bigfoot until recently.",

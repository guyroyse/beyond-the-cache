  "observed": "In the forest above Noyo Harbor and Dolphin Cove located at Fort Bragg, California. My friend Chris and myself were in Chris's house which over looks Noyo Bridge and the harbor. Chris came running into the back door of the house and called me, we ran out to the back yard and listened. Chris heard what he thought was a loose cow across the Noyo River. As we listened we heard a creature moving through the forest making very loud crashing sounds. The creature stopped; it was silent for a moment perhaps it saw us watching. Then we heard a grunting sound which became a very low frequency but loud moo, like a cow but deeper in pitch and  much more intense. The creature's yell went from a \"moo\" sound to a very high pitch scream unlike any sound I ever heard before or ever will again. After the creature yelled it took off again through the forest heading inland it took only a few seconds and it was to far away to hear the foot steps anymore. This animal sounded like no other and moved fast. Even a cow running through the forest could not make the sounds we heard or cover the same distance as quickly. It was a Big Foot.",

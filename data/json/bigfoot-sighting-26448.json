I live next to a 15,000 acre tree farm. I am a retired school teacher, attend church regularly, and am not a hoaxer.These incidents all happened plus many more, for a total  of about 21 over the seven years. The last being, last November; 5 howls then two instant tree  knock downs, which I found the next morning. These things seem incredible, but they honestly happened. As GOD is my witness they are true. I am truly convinced bigfoots exists.",

  "observed": "Late October of 1977.  I'm sorry this report is so old.  But the 2 women that were with me (one of which was my supervisor and was the driver) had become very frightened and immediately began dismissing what we had all seen.  Therefor I figured there was no use in telling a story that they were going to deny.  But perhaps this will help somebodys research. I saw a figure walking on 2 legs across a clearing located about 150 yards upslope from the road we were on.  I was with 2 young women co-workers (US Forest Service).  They refused to believe that it was anything but a man in dark clothing.  I did not  agree.  I had walked the same clearing myself hunting and there were some saplings scattered around the clearing. Judging the relative size of the trees, the comparative height of the walking figure and the speed at which he crossed the clearing I calculated that the figure could not have been any less than 8 to 9' in height and he covered a distance of at least 150 yards in no more than 20 seconds and this was at a leisurely pace.  I later went up to see if there were any tracks and unfortunately it was too grassy.  I did try to cover the same ground as the walking figure and at a full run, it still took me nearly a minute to cover the same ground the figure had in 20 seconds.  I don't know what it was I saw that day, but it no human being.",

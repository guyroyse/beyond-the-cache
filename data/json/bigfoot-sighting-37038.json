  "observed": "I was driving south on Hwy. 45 just south of the Mississippi state line not very far into Alabama. I was driving my 18 wheeler and it was about 8 p.m. I had my brights on and a car was approaching so i dimmed the lights. After the car had passed by I turned the brights back on... I couldn't believe at first what I saw. I had never heard of a blonde bigfoot but there it was. It was 7 feet tall or so and crossed a clearing in the woods that was at least 15 feet wide in two steps with a normal stride,not running, just out for a stroll. It never looked my way. This took place in Fruitdale Alabama on a Friday night in February of 2008. I have learned that this creature has been seen for years close to this area.",

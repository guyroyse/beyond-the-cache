  "observed": "I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot. While talking to a fisherman he told me in 2000 that many people were hearing cries around the Scioto River. While along the river I have heard the same cries. It sounded like it was calling out another creature. The cries echoed up the river for about a 1/4 mile. The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot. It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall. It appeared more manlike than ape-like. I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree. As I looked it peeked from around the tree and looked at me. My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot. As it moved so did the deer that were right behind me. I bolted and so did the deer. I think it was hunting the deer and the deer knew this. When I walked by the deer they stood still, then I saw the Bigfoot. The deer seemed confused on which direction to run away. This creature seemed to move very stealthlike like a kung fu like movement all in one motion. It seemed very smart and not afraid of me. It seems these animals travel the waterways as we do roads.",

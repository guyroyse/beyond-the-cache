  "observed": "On Dec, 20, 2000, my wife and daughter were walking along (withheld) Road when they spotted two large footprints in the snow about five feet off the road a quarter mile from our cabin. Due to the size of the prints, at first they thought it was a bear. But as they got closer, they saw it was a huge foot similar to a man's without shoes on. They came home insisting I come and look at this thing. I examined the print by placing my foot next to it. My shoe size is 10 1/2 and this print was five inches longer and double the width. I estimated it was 14 inches long with toes, and a slight curve in the arch area. It was left a mystery until today's Denver Post arrived with an article on bigfoot displaying the same footprint we examined on Dec. 20.",

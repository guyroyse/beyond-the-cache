  "observed": "This occurred southeast of Orlando. I was attending an on-site meeting for a new construction project in a very remote and undeveloped area southeast of Orlando. During the meeting, I kept noticing movement in the trees about 150 to 200 yards to the east of our group. I started to pay more attention, and began to realize that this was not a person or animal that I had seen before. It was far too large. It seemed to be ducking in and out behind the trees watching us. It never made a sound and after a couple of minutes, it turned and walked away on two legs into the thicker vegetation. After the meeting, I walked over to the area where I last saw it and the undergrowth was crushed down and you could see where something had passed through. I went to the last tree I saw it at and compared to the limbs on the tree, this thing was at least 7.5 to 8 feet tall. I am 6'2\" and could barely reach the limbs that were at the same height as this creature's head. No one else in the group seemed to notice and I didn't say anything as we were in a high profile professional meeting and I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I thought I was seeing a bigfoot. It would not have been a good thing for my employment situation. I have returned to the area several times as construction has continued, but I have not had any other sightings of this creature.",

  "observed": "Ok my wife and i decided to look at the fall leaves in covered brige canyon just off highway 6 about five minutes up spanish fork canyon. Instead of parking off the side of the road i decide to drive the short way up to the sterling hollow trailhead, so i get to the trail head and turn the jeep around so we could veiw the other side of the canyon. We decide to get out and we are standing in front of the jeep talking quietly, and my wife says she wants to sit in the jeep so i ask her why and she says she dont feel good about standing there, i had also noticed that uneasy feeling and agreed. I opened the passenger door for her then went around to the driver side and got in. I found the keys and started to start the jeep when i looked at my wife who was staring at the small gassy flat. I turned the key and a big fast black hairy object made me turn my head to the left, and i saw it run very fast into the thick oak trees. It looked about 6 feet tall hunched over, but it covered alot of ground fast. I saw it for only a few seconds. I looked at my wife, she sat frozen and i  knew what i saw ( i thought it was a bigfoot) so i asked my wife if it was a bear she said no so i asked if it was a moose she said no so i asked if it was a black cow and she said it was a hairy bigfoot. She said she had watched it the whole time after i let her in the jeep and got in myself till i started the jeep, and she said it was a bigfoot. I hightailed it out of there and returned at dark with hunting equipment to track it, but only found where it went through the oak, the leaves were deep and the bank was torn up. i have been a avid hunter my whole life it was not any animal known to me, i know it was not a bear moose, elk ,cow,or anything i have ever seen.",

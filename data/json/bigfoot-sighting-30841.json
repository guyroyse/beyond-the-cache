  "observed": "It was about midnight and I was outside smoking a cigarette. All of a sudden I hear a strange noise I never heard of before in my life. It was coming up from the creek wooded area. Then after I heard it rustling in the woods, everything was quiet, except for a dog howling and going crazy! The sound literally gave me cold chills and made the hair stand up on my neck. Then there was a clearing in the trees and saw a dark figure walking around in the creek lit by the moonlight. I was really scared of moving and after a few minutes, I lost it in the trees. Then I got up and went back inside.",

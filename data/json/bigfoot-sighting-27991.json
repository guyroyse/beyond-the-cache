  "observed": "I am submitting this report on behalf of the witness.  The witness is an elderly man who does not have access to a computer. I recorded my interview with him and am posting an excerpt from that interview here in lieu of a written report. In summary, the witness was driving home around 9:00am.  He started crossing the railroad tracks when he noticed a dark animal sitting near the tracks about a thousand feet away from him.  He watched it for about ten minutes when it got up \"like a man\" and walked into the forest.",

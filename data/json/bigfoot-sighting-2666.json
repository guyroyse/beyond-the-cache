  "observed": "On or about May 17th 2001, My Boyfriend and I were fishing at Liberty Watershed in Baltimore county. It was early in the morning, we arrived at 8 am. We parked at ********* road and walked down to the water which took about 10 min. As he was preparing to fish ( I am not really into fishing) I was looking around. I noticed that the fish were jumping so there was a good bit of water splashing, but I heard what sounded like someone running through the water in a shallow area. I asked him what it was but he didn't know and we thought it was just the fish. Then around 10 I saw something moving around in the swamp area (the same area where the wading sounds were coming from. In a split second I saw what appeared to be a large man with rasta type hair. I called for my boyfreind but \"the man\" was already disapearing through the woods. He did happen to see the branches moving though. I asked him what that was but he couldn't tell. I am not sure exactly what I saw but I looked through and found pictures of Bigfoot and I wholeheartedly beleive that that is what I saw.",

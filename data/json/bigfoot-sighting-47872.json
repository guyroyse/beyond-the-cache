  "observed": "Out in forest headed to my firewood cutting spot about 12 miles NW of town. Upon a certain area on top side of mountain I spotted something out of my left side of sight as I stopped and looked I saw a blackish figure walk behind a large slash pile. I only saw it for 2 seconds as it walked and looked at me until it disappeared behind slash pile and into woods. I almost went out to look for tracks, but honestly I was afraid. I've been in the woods for years, avid hunter and open minded, but I KNOW what I saw was a BIGFOOT.",

  "observed": "Walking on my creek in West Central Georgia which I visit almost daily, bass fishing. Watching 2 geese with their babies, all of the sudden they all flew off and I started to get this really weird feeling like something was watching me. Turned around to walk back up the creek and heard a huge chrashing in the brush across from me and I stood still thinking it was a wild hog which has tried to attack me in the past. Started looking and couldn't get any really visible detail but saw what I am estimating as a 7 foot creature in the brush. I hollered at it and it backed up and completely dissapeared. Needless to say I got out of there.",

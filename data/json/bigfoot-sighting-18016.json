  "observed": "We live about a mile from Austin Bridge Road in Paulding County, Georgia.  We believe we may have seen whatever it is was seen in your Report # 14887.   We were going to drive out to Hiram for dinner in our Suburban;  and were heading towards Ridge Road on Austin Bridge.  Near where Austin Bridge intersects Mein Mitchell Road; we saw what I would describe as an animal with the basic body structure of a bear but standing on it's hind legs;  and a face that seemed more wolfish than anything else.   It had to be about 9 feet tall.  It stood in the road.  At about 200 yards we decided to pull the vehicle around and go a different direction rather than drive any closer.",

  "observed": "To start off I've been interested in cryptozoology since i was about twelve years old. I was about fourteen yrs. old and living on Mt. union rd. at the time. It was about 9:00pm on a fall night. My cousin and I were sitting on the hill next to our storage building smoking a cigarette and looking down into the holler next to the road. All of a sudden we heard something move down over the hill so I whispered \"shush, if we’re quiet we may see a deer.\" We continued to sit there, about 2 min, until a car came down the hill and its lights flashed on something tall standing near the bottom. It turns to its side quickly then looks up the hill towards us. After the car had passed it was dark again and he heard something huff and puff and then it sounded like it took off up the hill running towards us so we ran to the house about 30 yards away. We ran inside the house and never heard anything the rest of the night.",

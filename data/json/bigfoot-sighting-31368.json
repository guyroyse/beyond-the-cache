  "observed": "I was leaving a freinds house a little after 9 pm on a week night headed home. I was on my motorcycle going east on KY 8 about to come up on a bend in the road. I had lived in this area for about 5 years and had just recently moved. In the years of living in this area and being an avid bow hunter, I have observed lots of deer crossing the road just around this bend. I slowed down because the sun had set not long before and the deer move at that time.  As I came around the bend, I realized there was  something in the road in the oncoming lane. I slowed down futher, it was crossing the road into my lane. I rapidly slowed and swirved left to go behind it. I almost hit it, missed it less than a foot. I stopped about 10 feet past where it crossed in front of me. I quickly turned around in the road and aimed my light on it as it went into the thick brushline next to the road. It was about 36 to 42 inches tall, short legs and long arms, black hair 4 to 5 inches long, walking upright bipedily.",

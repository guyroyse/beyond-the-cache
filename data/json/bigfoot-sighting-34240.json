  "observed": "I was riding in my mom's van, at 7:13 pm, as she drove past the recently built storage facility on Eagle Road, I looked out the right window and saw a black or brown (it was really dark outside and I could see it clearly so it had to be brown) human-like shape move around the far corner of the facility, and I didn't see it come around the other end. It wasnt a person because of its height. I dont know what I saw, but I'm certain it was not a person or a bear.",

  "observed": "On June 22,2014 at approximately 06:10, I witnessed what could only be described as a large male sasquatch. I was on my way to my work yard in New Caney Texas. It was very cloudy that morning with heavy dew rising. I was driving the speed limit 35mph looking for local wildlife like I do every morning. I might add this area is thickly wooded, but also is dotted with many homes. The area is also close to the river. I noticed a very tall shadowy figure approaching a group of cows with a calf. It was at least 8 to 9' tall and about 48 to 50\" wide at the shoulders. I slowed down as much as possible. It saw my brake lights and turned to look at me. I am a good judge of distance for I am a bow hunter and I estimated it to be 45 to 50 yards away. It had a long sloping forehead and very defined brow ridge. I could not tell what color its hair was but I noticed a long beard and its arms hung down to almost his knees. I struggled to get my phone out to take a picture by the time I got it out it turned and walked into the woods. I think it might have been going for the calf. There are many water sources in that area and abundant wildlife in those woods.",

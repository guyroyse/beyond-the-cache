  "observed": "I saw the figure thru my window, it just stood there just looking in at me. It didn't move or make any sound. I'm not sure how long it was there, it was already standing there when I happened to walk by and noticed something standing in front of the window and appeared to be looking in. About fifteen or so minutes later when I went to look at the window it was gone. The next day I went out to search for evidence but didn't find anything.",

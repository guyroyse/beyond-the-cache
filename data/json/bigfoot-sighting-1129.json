  "observed": "When I was about 12 years old, I was watching my younger cousin while at my grandparents house, they live on county road 489 in mountmorency county.  Anyway my cousin wanted to go to his house for something so we got on our bikes to leave for his house which was about a mile and 1/2 away on an old backroad, we were on granger road and I was about half a mile  in front of him and he was screaming for me to wait for him, so as I was waiting for him I was on part of the road that was surrounded by the forest.  then I heard soemthing crashing through the woods, and out of the corner of my eye I saw something black almost a reddish colored thign run out of the woods take one step into the road and leap across the rest.  It landed on the otherside and then  hoped over a small fence surrounding someones property then it was  gone.  I was 12 then and I'm 18 now and about 6'2\"  but this thing was at least 2 feet taller than I am now, maybe even close to 9 feet but I'm not sure.  everyone I told laughed and said it was just a bear or something, nto many believed me, but I know a beer can't jump like that and around here they don't get that big.",

  "observed": "I grew up in Happy Camp CA in which is a small town where Bigfoot is an icon! However, I have never believe in him. On Sunday April 18th, 2010, we saw a massive \"thing\" walking under Independence bridge. It was well over 6 ft tall and was dark and hairy! It was walking like a human! We thought it could of been a bear, but the way it was walking, there's absolutely no chance it was one! I had posted it on my Facebook, and a friend told me to talk to her husband because years ago, around the same area, he swore he saw a bigfoot! This has really sparked interest in me because as an un-believer, I can't come up with another conclusion of what it could of been! We were too afraid to stop, but we are so shocked and confused on what it could of been!!",

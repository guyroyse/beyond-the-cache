  "observed": "August 2011, while working for the US Forest Service I heard vocalizations in the Chippewa National Forest.These vocalizations are very similar to the central Michigan vocalizations. I was in a small clearing around noon when I heard a series of yelps followed by whoops.These vocalizations were about a mile apart from each other and about a half mile from me. It sounded like they were communicating with each other. The whoops were very GUTTURAL. The sounds were low and the yelps were high pitched. There are wolves in the area and I guarantee that they were not wolves. I posted a Youtube video, \"Cass lake MN Bigfoot Vocalization site\". I have been back several times but only heard wolves. My wife thought she saw something standing in the distance but we were unable to confirm.",

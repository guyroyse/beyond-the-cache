  "observed": "Because of today's report of a Bigfoot Body, my memory was jarred by a story from my now deceased grandfather. In the Fall of 1925 my grandfather and his brother were hunting duck around Horsehoe Lake in Bordelonville, Louisiana. The area was swampy and woodsy, but opened onto farm land and pastures. Paw Paw and my uncle were headed into the duck blinds at sunrise. The weather was cool and the steam was coming off the water. After climbing over a pasture fence with a kerosene lamp, they saw two red, round reflections in the tree line ahead of them. They stopped in their tracks as the \"lights\" came closer to them attracted to the light. Paw Paw said that he and his brother were frozen in fear and couldn't move. I don't know what the french name they used for it, but as it came closer it was a lumbering, furry figure, with red eyes reflecting in the light. When it came within a few feet, my uncle panicked and slapped my grandfather and they dropped everything they had with them and ran like hell all the way back home. That story is our family legend and I always thought they were joking when telling it. Maybe they weren't.",

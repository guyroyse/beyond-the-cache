  "observed": "While vacationing in south Georgia I decided to visit a remote forested area to listen to night sounds and make wildlife recordings. After sun set there were a lot of owls calling and several alligators growling from the nearby river. At one point I heard three wood knocks come from the forest, and as I continued to listen I heard two distant whoops. The hour grew late and I decided to leave my audio recorder behind, running overnight, to record anything else that might happen. When I retrieved the recorder in the morning I found several distant howls on it.",

  "observed": "I was 12 years old. I lived in a small town in Wisconsin named Merrill. It was about dusk and I was coming home from the neighbors. I had to cross the Railroad tracks to get to my house. When I got to the tracks I looked to my left and there about 25 yards away I saw a creature completely covered in dark brown hair. It was about 7 ft tall and it was definitely was not a bear. It was standing on 2 legs looking into the brush. It turned to look at me and I took off. I was so scared I ran across a very busy highway without even looking. That night I remember my dog was bartking fevorishly. I remember to this day how terrified I was. I'm 32 years old now and have only told 2 people about that experience. I don't know exactly what I saw, but from everything I've heard about the Yetti it could have been it. This incident occured about 2 miles north of town on Buisness highwat 51. The railroad tracks run right along the highway. Please let me know if  there has ever been any other sightings in this area.",

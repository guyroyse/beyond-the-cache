  "observed": "At about 11pm, after sitting silently in front of the campfire for a couple of hours, I all of a sudden started hearing a single, loud wailing sound.  It sounded like a cross between a wolf and 'tarzan'.  Somewhat human, but definitely not. The high-pitched howl that at first I thought was a wolf, became louder and longer, and was moving slowly through the woods about a quarter mile from me at most. It would stop briefly, then continue, sounded like something in pain or extremely lonely or lost, calling out for others. I heard no other calls in response, and I didn't utter a sound because I didn't want to scare it off. I was mesmerized.  It kept sounding off for about 10 minutes, then gone. It was not close enough to hear footsteps associated with it. VERY Loud vocalizations. When I realized that I've heard wolves, coyotes, and cougars before, I knew this was nothing of the sort. That's when my whole body got chills as I realized that I must be hearing a 'Sasquatch'. I can't say I had really ever considered that they exist or not. I was certainly open, but skeptical. Not Anymore!  I consider myself extremely lucky; most people will never hear such a thing.",

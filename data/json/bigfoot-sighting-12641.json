I was setting in the car talking looked up the road we came down and saw what looked like a big man walking down to where we were.  I turned on my head lights to see what or who it was. It run off in the woods. Well, we sat a minute then a smell like a wet animal started to came in the car. We heard a loud crashing comeing the woods and yelling screams. At that time a log came flying and hit my car. It moved my 1980 caddy it hit so hard. I started, the hit gas and was gone. We came back the next day to look around the log was there it was so heavy we could no move it we walk over where it must have came from in the woods it was 40 yards away.",

When I heard that howl it felt like lightning struck me. I looked to the right and at the bottom of a hill in the woods I saw a big brown figure hitting a tree. I pedaled as fast as I could and ran inside. I would like to speak to a researcher personally. I give permission to have my story put on the website.",

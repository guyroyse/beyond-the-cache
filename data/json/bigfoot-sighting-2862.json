  "observed": "3 pm, weather was sunny & mild, my husband and two kids were fishing on the Klamath River in Siskiyou Co. It was very quiet: no birds were singing, even the range cattle were nowhere around. We had been fishing for at least a couple miles. We smelt a sour, wet dog smell; we looked around and saw him across the river by the brush just standing there. He was very huge; he wasn't black but more like a dark brown. Hair seemed to be thick. The smell was pungent: that's something I can't forget. His/her hair covered the body. It stood there for a couple minutes, then crouched down and got a drink. We did not feel threatened by it. Up on the dirt road a loud jeep went by. I turned to look at the jeep, turned back, and he was gone.",

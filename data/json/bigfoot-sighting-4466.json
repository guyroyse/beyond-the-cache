  "observed": "I was 18 and a senior at Columbus East High school at the time this occured.   There is a park directly across the street from my house. It  was a warm spring  night. I was doing a report for school and it was getting rather late and I was the only person still up at the time. I was, to my best guess, 1:30 AM. I had just broken my last pencil and I needed another one to finish my report. I had to go outside to my car to get one. I had just shut the door to my truck to go back inside when i hear the most God-awful schrill scream in my life. I turned around quickly and could make out the vague outline of a large man-like creature running throught the park and back into the woods. The scream lasted for about six seconds. Needless to say I high tailed it back into the house. I told my parents in the morning and they said that they had hear nothing and that I all I hear was  a cat. The next day I pulled up a bigfoot website and listened to some wav files and the sounds that I heard were identical to what I had hear the previous night.",

  "observed": "My fiancee and I were driving on a road in Marysville, Washington called Hilltop Rd.  It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left.  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well.  With how steep the area it was that it went down, and how wooded and rainy it was I don't think a human could navigate its way down there as quickly as it did, because by the time I had stopped and gotten out it was gone, but you could hear the crashing of it moving through the brush and trees.",

To the right there is a steep hill it had to have come down judging by the foliage that it had slid down the hill in the direction it was headed. And to the left where it went to is a steep downward hill that had a lot of trees and obstacles.",

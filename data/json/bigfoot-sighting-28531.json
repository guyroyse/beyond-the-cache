  "observed": "Something heard. It was around 9:30 p.m. and a very dark night. I was unloading music gear from my truck in my garage. It was also particularly quiet. I first heard something that sounded like it may have been a man screaming. I stopped to listen, and heard it again much more clearly. It resembled the famous Columbiana recording, very very eerie. I recognized it because I was familiar with the recording from History Channel programs. I would describe what I heard as more like a roar than a howl, but still a combination of both. I estimate it to have been half a mile to a mile away. I was also able to hear it very clearly because of the quietness of the night. I'm certain that what I heard was not a dog or person or any other animal I could name. I have been casually interested in Bigfoot sightings over the years so am familiar with the sounds and circumstances of encounters.",

  "observed": "I was walking in the woods down a two track by Thompsonville in the early spring morning.  On these early morning walks I often scare up deer and occationally a bear so when I heard the noises of something running in the woods I expected to see some such animal.  Instead I saw what looked to me like a large man dressed in white running at an incredible speed.  He was about 50 yards away and I tracked him for some distance.  I was amazed at how he ran so fast through the dense undergrowth. He had to have long legs to be able to traverse the fallen trees and swampy areas. The next day I was walking in that same area and discovered tracks that confirmed to me it was not a man I had seen.  They were quite large - about 18 inches or so.  I could only see three toe prints thought there may have been more that didnt inprint and what may have been claws or long toenails that left a mark.  The distance between them was about three of my strides long. My neighbor who lives in that area has reported to me on a number of occasions that he has seen many evidences of what he firgured could only be big foot.  Marks on the trees and stolen food supplies that the situations to him indicated it was not a bear.  I had discounted the validity of his stories until I was a witness.",

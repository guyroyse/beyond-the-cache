  "observed": "Shaking of trees immediately upon getting out of truck. We were going hunting. Heard some knockings off in the distance. Walking down the trail, we could smell a foul smell (later we found the source which was a dead hog, couldn't tell if something had killed it and ate it or if it was shot and scavenged upon). Later while hunting we climbed up a small hill and I spotted something behind a large tree stump. I didn't say anything and the other witness pointed it out immediately too. We left the woods then.",

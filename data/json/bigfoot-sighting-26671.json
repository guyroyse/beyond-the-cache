  "observed": "My name is John, I visited my brother Howard in Boulder Co.Sept. 19 thru Sept 26 He has a cabin at Crystal Lakes , Co. near Red Feather Co. Elevation is above 8500 ft.We were at his cabin on Sunday but could not trout fish because of the snow for 2 1/2 days.Tues morning at about 7:30 I was standing at the front door of the cabin when I could see something black and walking upright heading for the aspen trees .I believe it was startled by a pickup truck comeing down this small dirt road. I ask my brother to look at this with the field glasses and I then look at it for several minutes as well as my brother.It looked to be about 7 to 8 ft tall and I estimated about 350 to 400 lbs. We went with a yard stick which is all we had to try and at least measure the foot print. It measured 17 inches long and 6 1/2 inches wide. We were going to track it for a while but the snow covered the tracks pretty good",

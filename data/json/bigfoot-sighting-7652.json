  "observed": "I was about 3 miles from the Sulphur River on family land. I walked down a creek bed to a pool on the other side. When I came back down the hill I stopped to relieve myself. Just as I started to step away I heard a high-pitched scream that startled me. A few seconds later it made the scream again. 25 yards in the thick woods I saw a slight movement. By a tree I saw a patch of dark brownish fur. Not sure what I was looking at, I held my ground and felt no fear. I was waiting for something normal to appear. I scanned the area but nothing else was moving. When I looked back to the patch of fur it was gone. Just when I was gonna shrug it off, I heard the scream again. This time it was behind me! As before, it screamed a second time. I spun around just in time to see it crouch behind a bush 20 yards from me. All I could see was the outline of a large head. It was moving around the bush trying to get a better look at me. About that time it occured to me - I didn't know what the hell this was. Now in fear for my life, I turned and walked quickly up the hill to my car. I never looked back until the car was moving. I didn't see it again.",

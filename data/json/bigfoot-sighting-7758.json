  "observed": "I was riding in the car with my friend, she was driving. It was the opening weekend of deer season, full moon, very bright. We were on a one lane gravel road in the Direct Bottoms. We saw less than 100 feet away from us a creature cross the road from left side of road to right. It was 7 to 8 feet tall, with long gray hair. It walked right in front of us. Its arms were longer than a man's, swinging them as it walked. It stepped right over a barbed-wire fence. A mile down the road, we turned around and got stuck in a wheat field. We were stuck 30 minutes. After we got the car unstuck, we went back the same way as we came in. We were scared that we would encounter the creature, but there was no sign of it. After all this time, I would love to see that creature again.",

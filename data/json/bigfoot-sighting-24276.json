It was 7miles west of Hwy 27.Had drove about 3miles on pavement and it turned to dirt. Hadnt been on the dirt road a mile or less and looked up the road and caught a black upright something on the edge of the road heading into the bushes.I know what I saw,but Im still in disbelief and feel strange telling anyone ,but I know what I saw. I wish I would have stopped and thought to check for foot prints, but It really spooked me and the kids after I told them.",

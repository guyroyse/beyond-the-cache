  "observed": "August 7th between 10:00 and ll:00 AM. Saturday. as driving on Highway 2 toward Levenworth.  I was about 10 minutes out of the town.  The car in front of me saw it first. He had to stop his car or he would have hit it.  Then, I stopped my car behind the first car.  The animal came from the right and was on the left side of the road, I only saw his back.  He was dark brown with golden highlights (from the sun shining on the coat). He then walked into the bushes on my left side of the road.  I didn't report it at the time because I didn't really believe it.  But, after looking at pictures of bears (on the net). I realized what I saw was too tall and too thin to be a bear.  My family said I should write.",

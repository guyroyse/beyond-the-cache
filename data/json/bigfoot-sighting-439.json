  "observed": "I live in a very rural area in Fayette County West Virginia,the small community of Rock Lick as i was surfing your website i was excited to find actual sound recordings taken in the bordering state of Ohio, listening to them i was immediately surprised that the Howl from the recordings was very familiar, many nights if your lucky and its quiet you can step out and hear this very unusual howl, it has been heard by my mother and I,on several accastions, we always wondered what the sound was,but dismissed it as just something weird,but just days ago when my mother and I listened to the recordings we both agreed the howl was what we heard, every time we hear the howl,its at night usually fall or winter,and after 10:00 or 11:00 at night,and the hollow we live in is very quiet,never have i seen a creature or have i ever found tracks matching the ones on your website,but i have had friends who have seen strange things that meet your descriptions,but since they are third party i cannot confirm them, my mother and i will definetly be more watchful of sounds or strange things this fall and winter, the sound we heard was alot fainter than the recording but it echoed threw the hollow from about a mile or two away,if you knew the local terrain there are several directions it could come from, and thousands of undeveloped acres of woods,but it sends chills up your back when you hear it,because it is so unidentifiable.",

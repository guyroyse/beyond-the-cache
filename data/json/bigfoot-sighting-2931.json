  "observed": "It was about 1:30 am on Sunday, July 29, 2001. I was up watching television. My dogs started to bark, so I went to my door to see what was going on. I turned on my porch light, and called my dogs. When my dogs got to the porch, I smelt a strange odor. The air was filled with an odor of raw sewage and rotting meat. I went on out in my yard about 10 feet and looked around. Just over a fence that was about 5 yards from me, I noticed what I thought might be a bear up on two legs. I yelled for it to \"get out of here\". Then I noticed that instead of walking on all 4 legs, it walked like a human, upright. It was about 8 feet high and long, ape like arms. It had long hair on \"his\" body. Upon telling my grandmother this, she told me that she had been awakened by a strange deep growl.",

  "observed": "This sighting took place in Utah...Wasatch Mtns, 1962...I was five years old at the time. My dad was stationed at Hill AFB. One weekend in the spring my family and two others from the base went on a picnic. We traveled up in to the mountains off of hiway 89. We were in the Wasatch national forest, going toward the present day ski areas, only less developed at the time. There was snow on the higher peaks, but a pleasent day. The time was morning about 9:00 to 10:00 am. I couldn't wait to play in the mountains! When we arrived at our location, a open area just 100 yrds off the road, the adults started setting up the grill and setting up other things. I was with three other children around my age, and we ran off up the side of a large mountain. There we found an small open field and starting play hide-and go-seek. We were about 200 yds from our parents and there was no one else around, no cars, or other people. The area had a lot of smaller pines and scrub brush. We felt safe where we were. After 20 minutes or so we went up the mountain a little further and began playing. There was a small mound on the west side of where we were playing and I thought that would be a great spot to hide. As the counting began I ran around the mound and was trying to hide when, I got the feeling I was being watched. I turned around and about thirty feet from me, standing beside a large tree and bush was a very large creature.  It was just standing there watching me and I was looking at it. It didn't make any aggresive moves or sounds...it was just content watching me. It had reddish-brown long hair over its body. Dark eyes, and fairly tall. I slowly got up and started walking backward... our eyes locked on one another. Its like we both were in a trance or something. Some feeling inside of me told me this was not a safe situation and thats when I broke off the stare and ran as fast as I could. I ran right past my friends and started screeming all the way down the mountain. When I arrived at the picnic site, I was almost too excited to talk. I ran to my dad and told him what I saw and he and the other adults  agreed that I saw something... but perhaps only a deer or bobcat. My dad agreed to go back there to check this out. When we got back to the site...we of course found nothing, but later on as we were leaving the area, I happened to look up at the part of the mountain we were playing on and there it was again in the same spot...watching us leave! Before I could say anything, we rounded the corner and lost sight of it. For years after I was terrified of going in to forest alone. At the time of the incident there was no talk about bigfoot...It was not in the media and not on television. I just knew that I saw a strange creature. Years later I saw a photo or a drawing and it brought back this memory. I believe that this creature was watching us kids play and was very interested in us.",

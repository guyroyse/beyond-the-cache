But i will say it is in Chattooga County Georgia,  just a little north of Floyd County. I leave for work before daylight..I live way out in \"the sticks\" as folks say. I hadn't been a mile or so from home, when my headlights caught something, I first took to be some idiot in a monkey suit. but, then, I thought, why on earth would anyone do that, out here in the middle of nowhere, before daylight? I got, I would guess within 20 feet of it, my mind was trying to get some realistic answer.. It was not a bear.. this thing stood, I would guess seven to eight feet??? this thing, stood upright just like you and me does.. it stopped about in the middle of the road, I stopped to keep from hitting it... still unsure of what it was... I got a VERY GOOD look at it.. what it was? i don't know. what i saw? looked just like a big huge monkey walking up right just like you and me do. Will some people say I'm crazy? sure they will.. that's ok. i wouldn't believe it ether, if I hadn't been the one that seen it.",

  "observed": "I was about 14 years old,riding a honda 100 on Petticat Lake Rd. between Fence Lake Rd. and Imperial Heights. I was exploring back roads and found an old grown over drive and followed it.(I later discovered it led to a clearing where there was an abandoned cabin back then. Today there is a camp on that road.)The road was so overgrown I had to putt in so slow I could barely keep the bike up. After clearing the thick brush the road opened up and I could see quite far under the canopy of trees. About thirty yards in front of me a bigfoot ran from left to right. He ran like a man at full speed. My first thought was that a man in a gorilla costume was running through the woods,my next thought was that no man would be running through the woods in a gorilla costume. Especially way back in the woods where I was. I immediately spun the bike around a took off at full throttle, bending foot pegs and mirrors. I can still see him clear as a bell running through the forrest at full stride. Possibly this was a young  bigfoot because it was not lumbering but cruising through the woods at full stride like a bigfoot track star.It was alot of years before I went back in the woods much.",

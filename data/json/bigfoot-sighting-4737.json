  "observed": "Our family was coming home down I-5 from visiting our daughter in PeEll. It was a very warm spring day, discount that we have estimated in May 2000. We were traveling south bound just from the on ramp. We saw a very large figure crossing the rail road tracks. It was probably 8' or 8 1/2' tall. It moved gracefully across the rail road tracks. At first I thought it was a man dressed up in a dark brown fur suit. Some one said, \"Did you see that?\" and then the 3 of us started trying to rationalize what we had seen. Almost at the same time we said that was a Big Foot! We have never told anyone about this until today at the Onalaska Sportsman Show. We saw the BFRO exhibit and my husband talked to Kevin Lindley, next thing I know we were sitting down telling our story. We have really tried to discount the idea that it was something else we saw, but we know what it was, a Big Foot. He was large, long arms, dark brown fur from head to toe. It was in the area of the steam train, but the other tracks that the AM Trak travels.",

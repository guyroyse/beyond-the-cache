  "observed": "I was coming home from a night class at Del. Tech.  I usually take a back road over to route 9 to get home faster.  So i left college and made my way home on my normal backroad detour.  I got throught the first half of the twisted road and came up on the stop sign to turn right on to Asbury road.  As i did i turned on my high beams.  I came around a turn that leads to about a quater-mile, or a little more, stretch of road.  About 3/4 of the way down the road i could make out a standing figure next to a utility pole.  So immeadiatly i turned off my high beams, thinking it was a person because it was standing up.  As i got closer to this being i was taken back by its size.  I started to slow down not knowing it, i guess because i was puzzled and curious.  As i stared I could make out its bottom side, broad shoulders, the fact that it was standing with its back to me looking into the woods, and hair that came to a point at the top of its head.  This entire figure had a thick black cover of hair, with no hair on its hands.   I could not see its feet.  Standing next to the utility pole gave me some reference for height.  I estimate it was aorund 7 to 8 ft tall.  I was almost past this creature when it looked at me and then looked back to the woods as if it did'nt care i was there.  Once i made eye contact the hair on my arms stood up and i peeled out of the location.  I was confused as to what just happened and could'nt believe what i witnessed.  It also is hard to comprehend that i have seen a bigfoot and I have seen something that does'nt exist.",

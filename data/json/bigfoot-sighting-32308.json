  "observed": "Around 2 or 3 am I was woken by a sound that I can only describe as a mixture of a whooping, screaming, howl. I have heard coyotes and bobcats and this was not anything like that. (In fact I did hear coyotes howling and yipping later in the evening) I patted my son on the leg and he responded in a whisper that he was awake and he heard it too; we laid there for several minutes and then we heard a whistling noise moving through the swamp around the perimeter of our camp. It was not like a bird it was almost like a human whistling a tune but much louder. The whistling lasted for several minutes. It was long drawn out whistles not just 2 or 3 seconds and then a pause. Another hour or so later I woke up again just in time to see a silhouette pass by the backside of the tent.",

  "observed": "Several years ago while hunting in southern Oregon on top of Wagner peak just southwest of Ashland Oregon, My father and I happened across A very large almost humon type track in the snow , it appeared to be 14 to 18 inches long ,6 or maybe 7 inches wide , the snow had been melting but it was no humon footprint , there were five distintive toes , and what looked like another heal print about 4 or 5 feet ahead of the other. On other hunting trips I have smelled very foul odor in that general area. And no sign of any wildlife at all . Its been atleast five years sence ive been up there. Its diffacult to give an exact location without showing someone, but its around a mile or two below the peak by trail where i saw the tracks onthe southwest side. However the odors seem to be mostly allways on the southeast side and east side in the heavy timber.",

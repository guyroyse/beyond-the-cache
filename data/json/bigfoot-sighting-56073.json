  "observed": "Not sure What I saw, I thought it may have been a Black bear since they are starting to populate Northeast Ohio. I was in the back of my property and cutting the grass and clearing the path I use behind my house in the woods to target shoot. It was earlier this fall in the beginning of October. I saw something out of the corner of my eye and I stopped the mower and looked towards something I saw moving in the brush along a ravine. I did not see it's face but I watched it for about a minute walking away from me. The funny thing is that it was walking upright which I know bears can do but I am not sure for how long. I am not sure if the mower I was riding startled it. I wanted to contact the local law enforcement but they would think I was crazy. All I can say for sure is that there has been a number of Gunieas and turkeys that my neighbor raises that have been eaten, since I find the feathers all over the place in my pasture and in my neighbors property. My neighbor has even put up a trail camera but to date all he has captured was some coyotes and foxes on it. I have not told anyone not even my neighbor who put up the trail cameras for fear they will think I am crazy. He thinks it is just the fox or coyotes. I investigated the area the next day and I am not ashamed to say I was afraid that day. All I found was disturbed brush and a game trail that I imagine the deer and other animals use. It feels good to write this story for my peace of mind.",

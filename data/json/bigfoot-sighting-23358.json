  "date": "2006-11-17",
  "timestamp": 1163721600,
  "observed": "It was standing on the side of the road, as if it was waiting to cross.  It was standing next to a large diamond road sign that I believe is about 7 feet tall.  It was taller than the sign by a head, making it about 8 feet tall.  It was illuminated by the side lights on my car, so I didn't see much definition in the face, but I saw a good outline of the head, and I saw a distinct large head that was not particularly pointed, but was sloping. The shoulders were massive and boxy.  The arms were long and hung down to the knees.  It was light colored, almost the color of the oak leaves in the fall.  The hair was short, about 3-4 inches long, and normal in distribution-it was not bushy.  I say \"it\" because I didn't notice any anatomy.",

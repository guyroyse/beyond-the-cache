  "observed": "I live in Biron, Wisconsin.  It was around 6-7 p.m. and my friends and I went out to the forest close to my house and I did a couple \"whoop\" calls. About 10 seconds after I did these calls, we heard a long howl that lasted about 5 seconds in length. We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl. As we were leaving, we heard three \"whoops\" in the same direction as we heard the howl. After we heard that, we all ran back to the house",

  "observed": "Me and my kids was traveling to Idabel Ok. June 19,2009. We took I-40 to Heneretta Ok. and then went South on the Indian Nation Turnpike, when my daughter 17yrs. said \"mom I think I just seen Bigfoot or something walking into the woods, I asked her what was it and she stated that whatever she saw looked like a man but had brownish hair all over it's body. I asked her did she see it's face and she said she could only see the back of it's head walking into the trees, she said it caught her attention because the trees in that area didn't have branches or leaves on the bottom part of the tree only at the top, so she could see it real good. I didn't think much about it until we were on our way back home and as we approached the area where she said she saw something I noticed a sign that said, \" Eufaula Exit\" and then I remembered seeing a special on cable about Bigfoot sightings in Oklahoma and one of the places that talked about was Eufaula.",

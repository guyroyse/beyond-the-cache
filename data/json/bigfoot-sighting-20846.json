  "observed": "On June the 18th 2007, my daughter and I were going to Whites Run near Seneca Rocks to go trout fishing and camping.  It was very late,around 1:00 in the A.M., with very little moon.  I was coming to the top of a mountain with a speed of around 40 miles an hour on US33/St. Rt. 55. As I reached the top of the mountain two furry looking beings were directly in front of our vehicle and both of them looked at my daughter and I and then took a dive into some bushes on the right shoulder of the hwy.  The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.  I did fish the next day but as far as camping that was a big OUT, NO WAY on this trip.",

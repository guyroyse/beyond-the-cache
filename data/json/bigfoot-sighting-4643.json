Below is the response I recieved from the NYS DEC investigator assigned to the original incident. Also enclosed is the original Corning Leader newspaper report on the incident. I am continuing my efforts to track down the hair samples and obtain photos of the original footprint casts taken by the NYS DEC.

Date:    7/10/02 11:02:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time From:    jafodge@gw.dec.state.ny.us (James Fodge) To:    CaptainNya@aol.com  Your recent request for information about the Addison Big Foot was forwarded to me. I was the one who investigated this. In my 30 years working for the Bureau of Wildlife I have been called on to investigate some very strange things, all of which were explainable in one way or another. This was the exception. I have to agree with the newspaper statement that if this was a hoax, it was a beauty. I was kind of hoping Bigfoot would show up again, but no such luck. The best hope of solving this was the hair-like material we found at the site and subsequently sent to Cornell. I never got an official report back but I did hear that it was never identified. I guess we'll just have to wait for it to show up again. Jim Fodge ******************** >>>",

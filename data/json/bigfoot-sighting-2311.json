  "observed": "While walking on a road headed toward Bert Reed's historic cabin on the Stanislaus National Forest, the forest suddenly went silent, and then something in the brush screamed at me and the person I was with.  We were unable to see what had made the sound.  We felt like something was watching us, and we both had a terrible fear (but we had both come across bears and other animals in the forest, and never felt this type of fear before).  The fear made us unable to move or speak. After several minutes, the regular forest noises started again, and since we felt better (like we weren't going to die), we were able to move away from the location.  We continued on to where we were headed, and on the way back, we went by the same location, but nothing was there.",

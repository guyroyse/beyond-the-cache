  "observed": "On December 27th, 2014, I was traveling home at approximately 11:45pm. I was near a wildlife area when I observed a large figure standing next to the treeline approximately 15-20 feet from the road. This figure was very large, broad shoulders and standing on two legs. I believe that I observed the backside of this figure as it was walking into the treeline since I could not see eyes in my headlights. I quickly stopped my vehicle to look at what I just saw but at that point my headlights were past the figure and I couldn't see anything. The location of this sighting was about a quarter mile north of the Creek bottoms. I quickly left the area to continue my trip home since I was alone.",

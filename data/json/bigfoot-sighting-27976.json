  "observed": "July 10, 2010. Four miles South of Lafayette, Indiana and nine miles West. On the East bank of the Wabash river. Approximately 1:30am. Two friends and I heard Unfamiliar vocalization coming from within approximately 1000 ft of our campfire.We were looking for a lost 4 week old kitten at the time. This vocalization set off a series of responses from other wildlife up and down the river for the next three or four minutes. We are all familiar with MOST of the wildlife in that area and could not place that deep voice from anything familiar. Apparently what ever it is, it answers to \"Kitty Kitty\". We didn't call kitty kitty anymore that night.",

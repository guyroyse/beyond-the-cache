  "observed": "Walking the trails there are small ponds near one parking lot.  Back in February, I had heard 3 equal-length whoops while in the woods there, about 10 seconds before a train came through.  I thought it was probably an owl. Tuesday afternoon, the 26th, I took this picture near the edge of the smallest ponds near the parking lot.  I took the photo because I thought it was odd that a bare human-looking footprint would be there in the mud, fairly fresh, as the nightly temperatures had been near or at freezing recently, and the water/mud would have been quite cold too.  The more I looked at the footprint, I noticed how flat the sole was and how even the toes were.  I don't know what to make of it, so I'm reporting it here.",

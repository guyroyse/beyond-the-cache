  "observed": "My son and I was driving down FM1008 (Kenefick) heading towards our road hwy 321. It was about 11PM. I was driving around a curve and it was just there. His face was as tall as the speeding sign that he was standing next to as if he was crossing the road. If I was 20 seconds later I would have hit a man that had hair covering his whole body except I could see his mouth and nose with no hair; the eyes were pretty clear of any facial hair also. He \"looked\" upset.Clearly not sure what it was that my son and I saw but it was a man like being that was as tall as the street sign. My headlights reflected off the sign as this thing turned his face to see us and we see him. It was practically in my windshield. I would have hit him if I had not swirved.",

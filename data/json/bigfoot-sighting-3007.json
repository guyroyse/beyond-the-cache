  "observed": "While mt. biking near a creek I stoped for a break and noticed a set of foot prints that followed the edge of the creek.  It was mid febuary and I thought what kids would be out with no shoes this time of year.  I joked to myself \"baby bigfoot\".  The tracks in soft mudd showed very clearly had no arch.   At the time I didnt think a bigfoot would live around here and just went on my way.  It wasnt till i read the report of a sighting one mile from this location that I considered fileing this report.  one other detail the creases in the print looked the texture of a crumbled paper bag.not smooth. I would guess the sizes 8 and 10 (shoe size)  I ride alone alot and would rather not have bigfoot around here.",

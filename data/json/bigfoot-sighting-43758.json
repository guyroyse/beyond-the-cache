  "observed": "When I was fourteen, I am 39 now, I was out rabbit hunting on our farm. It was getting dark so I started walking towards home. I entered the field to head up the hill, just then I saw a very dark figure \"crawling\" on the ground.  It reminded me of an alligator walking due to it wasn't using its rear legs.  Instead it was dragging them behind it while on its hands and stomach. I was unable to tell where it went from there, it had gotten very dark and I stayed put until my dad came looking for me with the tractor. I was too afraid to keep going due to fear. I remember it was hairy like an animal and appeared long in length. I went down the next day and seen where the drag marks were from it dragging its feet and where it seemed to get up and walk into the woods. Large footprints were still in the ground. Not sure anyone would believe me, I never told anyone. I was raised around all animals on the farm, been told what large animals were in the area. Never seen anything like it.",

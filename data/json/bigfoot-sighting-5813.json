  "observed": "It happened one night when my brother in law and my sister had to take me home from a date because I got grounded and we drove my date home over North Ogden divide and then on our way back over the divide to Eden. As we just went over the top I noticed that there were no cars in the parking lot. It was 12:30 a.m. and dark.  As we went another 100-200 yards down the valley side we noticed a person crossing the road, but as we got closer we could tell it was not a person but it was about 7 to 8 ft tall and hairy. By the time we were to pass it my brother-in-law rolled down his window and yelled \"get out of the road!\" my sister asked what do you think that was and my brother in-law said \"it was probably some kid dressed in a gorilla suit\" but as we thought about it, it did not make sense because there were no cars and there was no where to park other than the top. And after we yelled at it, it just walked up into the mountains. I know that I saw something that was about 8 ft tall very dark and hairy my only conclusion is that it was bigfoot",

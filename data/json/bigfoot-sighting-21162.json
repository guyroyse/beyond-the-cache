  "observed": "Sound:  Whoop Howl. This occurred on the evening of the 22nd of August.  We were staying at the Swift Creek camp ground which is in Yellowstone Canyon on the border of the high Uintas Wilderness (Take the moon lake highway from Duschene, Utah)  We have a hybrid camp trailer and were just settling down to go to bed.  The sound was distant but distinct.  Both the wife and kids heard it and started to question what it was.  I told them it was a cow :)  Our Springer Spanial did not get upset or bark.  It only lasted 30 seconds or so but I knew it was the same sound I had heard on this website. I am not sure what kind of animal it is that makes this sound but would like to have it proven one way or another.",

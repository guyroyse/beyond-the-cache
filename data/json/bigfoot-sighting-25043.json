  "observed": "it was autumn, and 4 or 5 of us decided to go camping. we went to the chattahoochee national forest in murray county ga.we had been there many times before, and seen many kinds of wildlife bear, deer, turkey and wild hogs. we set up camp and built a fire beside a creek. we sat there talking and telling stories and such. well around 11:oo p.m we started hearing strange noises like a high pitch shrill .someone in the group said it could be a panther since they have been known to scream. we sat there about another hour or so with the noises happening around every 20 minutes or so.then we heard limbs moving and twigs cracking from the other side of the creek. so we all looked that direction and just could make out the brush and trees at the edge of the creek. it sounded like whatever it was started getting closer.when all of a suuden we all seen limbs from the magnolia trees moving and out step this figure into the fire light.it took 2 more steps, then we all could plainly see it.it was around 6'5'' or 7' tall with a huge broad chest maybe 3' wide. one of my friends got scared and dove into the tent and made a bit of noise,but it didnt seem startled. it looked at us and then squated by the edge of the water. it appeared to be doing something with its hands,all the while keeping a dead stere on us.then we all pretty much paniced, and it calmly stood up and walked out of distance of the light and our flashlights.",

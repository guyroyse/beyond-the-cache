  "observed": "Less than one mile from home, driving to work going west on FL route 2,  the car windows were closed with the air conditioning on and the radio was playing.  On the north side of the road just outside of a pine tree farm, a large animal had started crossing the road.  It was down on all fours, and it looked like a giant foot stool.  It was reddish-brown with long hair, the head sat directly on its shoulders, but the face was looking away from me up the hill. The chest was flat like a human, not curved down like a large dog or bear.  I was surprised to see the animal glide across the road, for I didnt see its knees bend and it wasnt in a hurry.  It crossed to the south side of the road and disappeared into the thicket, which composed most of the south side of the road, with Ten Mile Creek at the bottom of the hill.",

  "observed": "May 15th, 2001 My wife and I recently relocated to Sonora from San Jose Ca. I live in the vicinity of Nile River Drive. My back yard is open to the forest before you get to Comstock Ranch. Well my wife and I were just finishing up dinner. The sun had just set and I decided to let my 2 small dogs off the deck and let them run around outside. About 10 minutes while I was at the back of the house, I heard this indescribable scream. I told my wife to let the dogs in as I could hear through an open window the rustling around, one of my dogs was barking...I ran to open the sliding glass door...only one dog made it back in. The other one never came home. I contacted DFG and notified them of the screams that I heard. I still hear them every once in a while coming from the back of my home that leads to the forest. I do not let my dogs outside at night any longer.",

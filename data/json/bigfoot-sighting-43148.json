  "observed": "I reported a sighting a while back.  I went to Beall Woods State Park, it was summer but getting near fall. I took my dog out for a walk for the first time ever, as we got to the very first fork in the trails my dog became very scared like he smelled something but I couldn't. So I took the plum tree trail which goes off to the right and next to a very large ravine. As I got closer to the spill way of it my dog would not move as he was looking at something at the bottom of the ravine. I watched for about thirty seconds and then it moved. It was  tall and lean like a track runner. As he turned he saw me, no sound but just wide eyed and opened mouthed. As I backed up he took two steps toward me, that is when my dog barked a very forceful bark that then it stopped and took a step back as I got farther back. I turned and walked very gingerly out of there. As I did i could hear it climb the wall of the ravine in like two steps then through the woods. We left and we have gone back but no face to face like that but whoops and wood knocks",

  "observed": "while driving northbound on hwy 20  approx 2 miles south of the deception pass bridge   I was looking out the passenger side window at the passing scenery   something xaught my eye and when I looked up into the treeline, I could clearly make out the outline of what appeared to be a humanlike form, sitting on a branch leaning out to the side   holding on with one arm   I say human-like because it did not appear to be someone just sitting in a tree   it had a low slope0like set to its head and I did not see any clothes   it reminded me of how you see large primates sitting on branches, watching what is passing by beneath them we were not in a position to turn around  and I have not seen anything since",

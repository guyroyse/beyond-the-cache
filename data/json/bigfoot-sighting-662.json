  "observed": "Long drag marks of something very large pulled through a small clearing and then through very dense clumps of Oregon grape, huckleberry, and what I would guess was manzanita. These shrubs and small trees had significant damage to them.  I would have discounted this as the work of a Bear, but for the fact that the damage reached a height in excess of ten feet on the scattered trees along the drag path and the drag marks continued for almost 200yrds before gradually diminishing.(This while going up an incline). About two hours later my cousin and I were on the south east side of Baldface creek and noticed a large (at least seven to eight feet tall)  animal covered with dark brown fur sitting on a stump (Yes, sitting on a stump!) watching us directly across from where we where hiking. The animal stood made a gesture and strode off into the surrounding forest. Curious we decided to try to get a closer look as we descended toward the bottom of the hill to the creek we heard a large amount of noise and turned to see that not 100 yards more and we would have run into a bear and her cub feeding off the berry bushes along our previous path. Till this day I am Unsure of the creature I saw, and question whether or not it was motioning my cousin and I out of potential danger.",

  "observed": "I was canoeing on the Sipsey river in Alabama. It was dusk as I was pulling out of the river and I was trying to hurry to get all my gear in the car before it got dark as it was about a 60 yard walk up this steep hill to where my car was. Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud \"WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP\", then a pause then three more whoops. I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You've never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought \"This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?\" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few \"unusual\" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I'm short on time. The WHOOOPS were the important thing, scared the hell out of me.",

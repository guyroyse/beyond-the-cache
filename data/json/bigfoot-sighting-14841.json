  "observed": "I lived in Welches, Oregon.  I am 42 yr old now.  This was 2 1/2 years ago, in November 2003.  I was living in an apartment over a garage overlooking the Salmon River. At around 6pm there was a large bang on my front door. The door was locked, thank goodness.  I called 911 and told them that something banged on my door, and I was alone and scared.  I lived right next to the Mt. Hood National Forest.  No families lived there in the winter time.  If something happened to me no one would hear me scream.  I heard grunting.  I looked out onto my deck, through the windows and I saw those eyes.  It had to be huge animal. It was there watching me and I was watching it.  It blinked its eyes, but it was like the animal was frozen with its eyes set on me.  It had a furry head. It took 3 hours for the police to show up.  They came in on foot, from down the road, but did not see anything when they looked around.",

  "observed": "In 1994  I was hunting deer and hogs in fla on a farm with a lot of under developed land on it. i was walking around a clear cut heading into the back part of the land i smelled something that did not smell right. the smell was, well as close as i can describe it, like a bear that had been sprayed by a skunk, but i have been hunting all my life and no skunk or bear every smelled like that. i turnd a curve about 40yards away. i saw a animal that was app.6'9\" to 7'4\". i am 6'6' and it was taller than i am.the color was a shi--- brenal brown. it was on 2 feet, it turned, i went to my knee to brace for a shot if it came toward me. it ran faster than any man i have seen run. it ran in to the woods. the reason i did not shoot it was possable endangered species or the slim chance it was some one in a suit. i dont think it was a suit. i have been hunting all my life, i still dont know what it was. p.s.  i had a chance to look up the laws if one was shot but can't find any thing. what do you think the repercusions would be? the fish and wild life say that there is no black fl. panther, but if you shoot one you will go to jail?",

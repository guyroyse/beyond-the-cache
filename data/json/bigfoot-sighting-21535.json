  "observed": "This happened on a camping trip on the weekend of 08/04 and 05/2007. I went with my friend, girlfriend and son to an archery shoot in Clint's Well Arizona. I live about one hour away. This area is centered from Strawberry Az. and Winslow Arizona. We were camping off of the Lake Mary Road by Clint's well in the forest area. On the early morning of 08/05/07 at about 3am I was woke in the tent by a loud knocking of wood on a tree west of camp. I lisened for about ten minutes and heard several whoop type sounds(approximately 3). These were consistent with the recordings on the website. I waited for about a half hour and did not here anymore noise and fell asleep. The next day I spoke with my native american friend who was in the tent next to mine during the archery shoot. He asked if I was woke by the noises last night. I advised him what I had heard and he told me he had heard the same noises. When we got back to the remote camp we searched the area of sign, but it had rained that afternoon and we located none. I have lived in Arizona all of my life and I'm 31 years old. I'm a police officer and I go in the woods on most of my days off. I've hunted elk, deer, bear, javalina and most all critters in my state. I have never heard the whoop type noises in all of my years in the woods or camping. The noise remined me of a howler monkey from tv. I know there have been alot of sightings on the White Mountian Apache reservation and by Heber Arizona. These areas are not far from our location.",

  "observed": "I had the ecnounter while in college in Ashland Wisconson in 1978. While bowhunting with a friend deep in the woods I took to sitting high in a tree overlooking thick briars. Out of the still and silence of the woods an animal came barreling through the thickest vegetation imaginable. It was thrashing about and shrieking at the highest pitch possible. I was frithened to death and could only stand to try to see it. I could not see it but did see the brush being shaken. Again the shrill sound of its voice filled the air. It was awesome to hear, scary but awesome. My friend who was hunting down from me did see it and it was on two legs and appeared apelike to him. We were too afraid to stick around and never went back. We went to an environmental college and I shared this with one of the professors Dr. V. He never heard of a local animal making that sound. That is my story and I tell it a dozen times a year. Good luck in your research!",

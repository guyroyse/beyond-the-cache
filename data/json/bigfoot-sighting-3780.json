  "observed": "I believe I was visited by a bigfoot.  I was living out on my family's 3/4 acre place.  It was heavily timbered with a year-round creek in the back of the property and a mobile home. The location is about 8 miles northeast of Grants Pass, Oregon. The year I believe was fall of 1978. I moved up from southern California to Oregon and on the night of the visit I was home alone.  I had been sleeping and I am guessing it was maybe 2 a.m. when I was awakened by heavy, bi-pedal footsteps walking around my 12 x 60 ft mobile home. Pine needles littered the grass and seemed to amplify the heavy steps. I have hunted and fished all my life and have never felt anything like that night: the sensation and fear of what was outside my trailer stomping around. Mind you my closest neighbor was 100 yards away on his 3/4 acre place. No man would have been tromping around my trailer that night. I sat up against the headboard of my bed with my rifle. I was shaking and scared and the hair was standing up on the back of my neck! I could not get up the courage to get up and look out the window. After some time the visitor walked away and after a couple of hours I dozed off until morning. I did not tell anyone because of ridicule.This really happened !",

  "observed": "[Prefatory Note 1: Some, but not all, of the grammar, spelling and structure from the original submission was edited for clarity. Usually we don't do this at all, to preserve the \"voice\" of the witness, but it was necessary in this case due to the length of the report, and by the request of the witnesses after he re-read his report online.] [Prefatory Note 2: The few statements and insertions shown in brackets [like this] were added by the investigator,  and were based on statements of the witness in the interviews.  They are inserted at the relevant points of the narative to give a clear picture of the events described.] [Prefatory Note 3: The recent information gathered (November 11, 2004) can be found at the bottom of the report.] Here is the story from witness David K.: \"In 1985 I was assigned as a Military Policeman to the US Army Garrison at Fort McPhearson, Ga.(Atlanta). We recieved a alert for my squad to go and secure the crash site of an AH-1 (Cobra) helicopter that belonged to the Texas Army National Guard that crashed in the Chatahoochee Forest, North of the Ranger Camp. We were helicoptered into the ranger camp with our gear and we boarded a \"Duece\" (2 1/2 ton truck) for the ride to the crash site. We made it to within about 1/4 mile of the site and had to carry our gear in.  We relieved the Rangers that were guarding the site (the crash occured about 12 hrs earlier) and set up camp. Our job was to keep people out of the area (curiosity seekers, news people, etc.) until the crash investigation team arrived and took over. The crash site was small, about 100 feet by 30 feet because the Cobra crashed in one piece and then burned, so the whole area had that fuel smell and that \"burned flesh\" smell.",

[The crash site is in the Blue Ridge Wildlife Refuge] The main N - S Park access (dirt and gravel) road was about two miles from the location. The Park starts about 1/2 mile north of Camp Darby and the access road is the road from Darby into the Park - follow this road for about 2 miles and take the right (north) fork. About 2-3 miles north of the fork and on the west side of the road is a large mountain (I dont know the name of it, and was probably only known as a number on the military maps, however I do not recall what it is) the incident occured near a ridge, about 1/3 of the way up mountain. If I had a military map of the area I could show you the exact location.",

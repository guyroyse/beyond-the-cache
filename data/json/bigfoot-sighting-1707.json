  "observed": "In the spring of 1980, I was working for the Department of Natural Resources planting trees on State lands along the Columbia River between the towns of Carson and Home Valley Washington. The whole crew saw two Sasquatches walking side by side down in a valley from where we were working. At first we thought they were bears, but no bears walk upright in perfect stride. We assumed these two were mates. Of course we had no binoculors to give us a better view. But to this day I still believe what we saw was Sasquatch.",

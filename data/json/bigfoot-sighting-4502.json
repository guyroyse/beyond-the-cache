  "observed": "My boyfriend and I were just leaving (edited). We were heading out of the drive way at about 2:30 A.M.  I seen something like a extremely tall male run across the road in front of us. It was a grayish, almost ghostly figure. I thought maybe it was just my imagination at first, but then my boyfriend stopped the car. He asked if I seen it too? Of course I told him yes. But then the figure stopped for a few seconds and started running away again. We sped off to come home because we were so freaked out by this incident.  I'm not 100% sure what the thing was, but I can tell you it was no man.",

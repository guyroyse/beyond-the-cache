WAS APPROACHING AND SOMETHING OR SOMEONE CAME OUT OF THE DITCH ON MY SIDE AND WITH 1 STRIDE CAME RIGHT UP TO MY CAR AND STARED RIGHT AT ME AS WENT BY. AS I SLOWED DOWN FOR THE STOP SIGN I LOOKED IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND IT WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD LOOKING AT ME. SORRY, DIDN'T STOP. CALLED MY FIANCE AT THE TIME (NOW MY HUBBY) AND WAS HISTERICAL. HE CALLED THE STATE PATROL AND THE DISPATCH SAID...THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A BIGFOOT REPORT. THIS THING WAS AT LEAST 6 TO 7 FEET TALL AND DARK. ALL I SAW WAS EYES ON TOP OF THIS MASSIVE BODY. SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME. JUST ASK MY HUBBY.",

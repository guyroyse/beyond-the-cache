  "observed": "When I was young,six years old, Ronnie Joe a friend of mine and myself was playing behind Ronnie's house.  We heard a thumbing sound and moved closer to see what was making the sound.  Just behind a neighbor's house we saw a big foot digging in the ground with a stick of fire wood, at times taking one stick of fire wood and pounding a second stick into the ground. Then he would turn the dirt over, using the stick like a spade. He may have been looking for food, but we never knew for sure. Then the bigfoot stood up and walked our way.  We were only 25ft. to 30ft. from the animal. It was showing its teeth but didn't make a sound.  This was a open field, bright sunshine lit day, nothing between us and the animal, so we got a good look but not a very long look at bigfoot. The animal had a dark brown coat with a lighter, almost grey vest.  He had large teeth and long \"dirty\" finger and toe nails. The nails looked very thick.",

  "observed": "It was early evening and our golden retriever was barking loudly. This was not unusual as there are many deer behind our house. Our back yard consists of a large twenty acre field leading into a wooded area. When I went outside to call the dog in and I saw six or seven deer running like heck like they were being chased, I looked behind them and in the tall grass a large hairy animal was chasing after them running on two legs towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time. We see occasional black bears but this was like no bear I had seen before. I am convinced it was a squatch. Then later in the season I was outside at around nine o-clock with a friend we had a small fire going. The coyotes were yipping in the far corner and in the opposite back corner there was a large screech like sound and the coyotes went dead silent.",

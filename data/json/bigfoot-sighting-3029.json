  "observed": "On 8-9-01 we were staying in a small cabin 9 miles from the Lassen Park entrance, about 2 miles from Viola on Highway 44.  My  wife woke me up as she heard a strange screaming-like sound.  I was immediately awake and heard what can only be described as a scream-like call that repeated itself.  It lasted about 25 seconds and was quite loud but seemed to be at least a half mile or so past our 20-acre spot, which is on a creek. I really didn't give it much thought although I knew it wasn't a mountain lion, bear or owl.  A few days later I mentioned it to a friend as the sound was so otherworldly and hard to describe.  He suggested and I rather skeptically checked a few bigfoot sites and was amazed to hear the same exact sound that had been recorded at different places in Nothern California and Oregon. It certainly doesn't sound like anything else. Can't say it was bigfoot, but the sound is exactly the same.",

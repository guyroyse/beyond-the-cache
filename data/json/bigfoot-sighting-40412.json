  "observed": "My name is ------.  I am a small animal veterinarian in western Massachusetts. On July 20, 2012 we were visiting our daughter, -----, in Missoula, Montana. We hiked up Waterworks (a ridge on the other side of I-90) around noon. We stopped to catch our breath and noticed a very large, dark unidentifiable object on the far ridge next to the power line poles.  It was unmoving..absolutely stock still for minutes(5-10?). We stood there looking at it wondering what it was.  All of a sudden it turned and took several large steps and disappeared over the ridge. We had my iPhone and by the time my daughter pushed the button he had gone over the ridge..we did get a picture of his head/shoulders. I can forward the picture to you.",

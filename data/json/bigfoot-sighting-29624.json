  "observed": "We were heading home from work approximately 11pm. There was rain and we came up on what we thought was a person along side of the the road but as we got closer, what we saw was something that was around 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall.Long dirty shaggy yellow looking hair. Could not see the face well because of all the hair. It had a tarp or piece of plastic over it. It was getting ready to cross the highway from a wooded area. As we passed it, my friend and I started describing what we both had seen and cold chills ran through my body. We were going to turn around and see if we could figure out what it was, but were to scared to. I have never seen anything like that in my life. It was not a man, it was entirely too tall. For several months after the seeing it, I wouldn't drive US1 at night, I instead traveled I95.",

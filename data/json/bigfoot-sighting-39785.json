  "observed": "Had a very unusual experience while deer hunting. I had shot a deer and spine shot it, it was doing a death scream until I dispatched it. I then field dressed it and was on my way out when I began hearing a terrible scream unlike anything i have ever heard before. It was heading right into the area I had just shot and field dressed the deer It continued the screaming for about five minutes getting closer and closer, I was about probably 200 yards from where I had field dressed the deer and could tell it was right there where I had just got the deer, needless to say I got out of there as fast as I possibly could, now I can't say that I have ever seen any sign of anything unusual there although I have never looked. I have heard trees fall on occasion while in my stand and it was calm out, never really gave thought to why they fell. Also on several occasions I have been followed out of the woods, I would walk, it would follow, I would stop it would stop. Now we do have bobcats in the area and I have heard they will do this and have heard them. I know whatever it was I heard that night was no bobcat. To this day I still have never heard a scream like that anywhere and do not hunt that area anymore. It spooked me bad enough that I avoid the area now.",

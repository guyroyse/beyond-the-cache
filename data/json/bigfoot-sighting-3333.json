My girlfriend grabbed my arm in fear. We were confronted by a large creature crossing the road. The creature turned and stared, it had ice blue eyes, was about seven and half feet tall. I guess it weighed maybe 350 to 450 lbs.  It took two steps to cross the road, pausing to look half way. This was in 1973, I believe the area is now known as Panthertown valley. I cannot forget those ice blue eyes.",

  "observed": "On the day after Christmas of 1992, I and my ex-husband were driving on the Deep River Mainline headed towards Naselle, Washington.  At the time my ex had an old Mercury Cougar, so you know that the front end of the vehicle was pretty big in width. The time of the day was evening and it was pretty dark and the only lights was coming from the car headlights. And it was snowing, too. So as we were heading to our destination, we saw something leap from one side to the other.  I knew that a bear could'nt of done that, because first they are in hibernation.  And if they were'nt it would have taken more than one leap to get across that narrow back road, and especially in front of a moving vehicle.  And yes it was bigger than a bear!",

  "observed": "My uncle, my six year old cousin, and I were on one of our little weekly expeditions to explore the surrounding mountains in Winnemucca, Nevada. We were walking up the foot of a mountain on the ridge of a wash and there was still about a foot and a half of snow on the ground when my cousin said that she saw a guy standing on top of the mountain and I said \"There's no one up there, it's to far from any civilizations. It's probably just a juniper bush.\" But about five minutes later, our 95 pound Doberman/Greyhound mix made a mad dash underneath the truck by the foot of the mountain. (And our dog was not one to be scared off easily, it scare's away anything that comes close to the house, and it even took on a mountain lion once, it has the scars on it's underbelly to prove it.) Just about the time me and my Uncle looked up towards where my cousin was pointing, we heard a low, droning howl and what I thought was the juniper bush, was animated now, walking downwards, and swaying side to side slightly. It spooked me and my uncle because on the way up we saw a totally decimated cow carcass! About that time we headed out to the truck because we were pretty shaken up by what we had just seen. We were reluctant to tell anyone in fear of being laughed at and ridiculed.",

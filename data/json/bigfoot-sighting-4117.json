  "observed": "Me and a friend pulled into a gas well a location i've been hunting for several years. When i pulled in i saw a tree stump that wasn't there before so i moved the car to put it in my headlights when i did the stump stood up and ran off on two legs. Let me tell you this creature has the best camo that ive ever seen. If he were to stand by a tree you wouldn't know he was there. When he ran he took long graceful strides as if he only weighed only ounces. When the light hit he didn't move at first but then he realized we saw him. He seems to sit on upper portions of open land surounded by dense under brush. I also seen him 2 years ago while turkey hunting by my self he was angry or he was building a home of sorts he was picking up trees larger than telephone poles and throwing them into a pile. He was difficlt to see, but his coloration is blended grays, and browns. This creature is surprisingly strong. He must have noticed me because he looked in my direction and the just dissapeared.",

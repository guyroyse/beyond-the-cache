  "observed": "I was driving back to Los Angeles from our second home in Mammoth.  I left very early, around 2:30 AM, as it is a long drive back to town, and I wanted to beat the traffic.  I left the house and was driving out of the complex.  The Snowcreek Golf Course  is on the left side of the road, and a field is on the right.  The road has a few curves in it. As I was coming around a curve, my headlights were shining into the field, and I saw a large figure walking, probably at least one hundred yards away.  I noticed that the figure seemed really large for being that far away from me.  It had a very definite stride, with its arms extended out in front, rotating from front to back.  It was traveling through the field at a good pace.  I thought gee, that's a really big guy walking, what is he doing out here so early in the morning, in that cold, dark field.  He didn't even turn his head with the headlights beaming in his direction, like it didn't bother him a bit.  He just kept walking towards town. I am not necessarily sold on the whole Bigfoot thing, but what I saw was pretty strange.",

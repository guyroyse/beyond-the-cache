  "observed": "dear sirs, 26 years ago myself, a cousin and a friend were getting ready to camp out here in a little town called mocksville nc, about 25 miles from winston salem nc.we were all teenagers enjoying the summer, after we pitched our tent, which was in a field about 200 yards from my friends house, the woods were about 100 yards away from us. As we were starting a fire, we heard something running in the woods, it was heading toward the edge of the woods at an incredible pace, when it was almost through the woods we took off running toward [friend's] house, we were running down a old motorcycle path, it was running through the knee high weeds, it still almost caught up to us, as we looked back it was standing in the fire throwing the logs out, it was at least 8 foot tall, very hairy, we ran to [friend's] house and told our story to his mom, now [friend's] mom had lived on a farm her whole life and wasnt easily scared, she laughed at us, and went outside to get some clothes off the line, a few minutes later she came running in scared to death, she said she had seen something unlike anything she had ever saw, it was huge she said, looked like a monkey of some kind but big, at least 8 foot tall, all that night we could hear it circle the house, it even came onto the porch a couple of times , we were all terrified, to scared to look out, and no phone to call for help, eventually daylight came and it was gone. after we got up we looked at the edge of the woods where it had came out, the branches were broke off up to about 8 feet, after that i read every book on bigfoot. and it made sense, the strong smell of urine, which we smelled before it came out of the woods, and the figure we saw, ive never told this before except to family but it is true and i have no doubt it was bigfoot.",

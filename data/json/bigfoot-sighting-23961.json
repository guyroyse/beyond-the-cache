  "observed": "In 2007, my mother—who had her trailer parked on some friends property—spent a few months camping in it last summer.  One particular night, around 8:00pm while she was watching TV, she said she had a feeling like she was being watched.  When she looked up out the window she could see something standing approximately 40 feet from the trailer.  She quickly realized it wasn’t a person, but something like a man was watching her. She said as quick as she blinked it was gone.  She estimated it to be between 6-1/2 to 7ft. tall.  There were some patio lights strewn outside, and the moonlight were enough for her to see that something was definitely standing outside.",

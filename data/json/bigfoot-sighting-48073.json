  "observed": "It was two years ago. In the summer on the volcan dam in Norway Michigan on the Menominee River in Marinette county. I was fishing for walleyes on the river. It was getting dark, so I decided to head back to the truck.I had a small head lamp you can get from Walmart.you had to walk back on the game trail to get to where I parked the truck. On the way back I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw orange colored eyes shine and a jet black figure that stood every bit of 7ft tall. He was just standing there watching me. The whole encounter lasted 5-10 seconds when he just turned around and walked away.I couldnt make out alot of the figures of the face due to the lamp light but I know what I saw.and the eye shine. Before I got back to the truck I knew he was there, I could feel him watching. And I heard a power break from a tree being broken.",

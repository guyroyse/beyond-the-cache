  "observed": "Tonight March 16 2012, I was driving through the moutains of WV going east on Rt. 33 towards Virginia at 10 pm or so. I was out with my friend and I was driving. I took a turn and my headlights hit a figure walking along the road behind the guard rails. I'm 7 foot one but this thing was built, I'm tall but this must have been 6 inches to a foot taller than me. Though I was driving I was only going 15mph around a turn so I had time to see it. It was walking behind the guard rail and there is no way it was a man, it was way too dark out. Right after I saw it I pretty much had a panic attack. My pulse went up and started breathing fast and shaking. I never believed there was such thing as one but I am sure I saw one. I just can not believe how bad it scared me.",

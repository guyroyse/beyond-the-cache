  "observed": "Was camped in my car watching a DVD when I heard what may have been a very loud tree knock to the west.  It seemed to come from the edge of the partial clearing I was in, perhaps 75 to 100 yards.  My first thought was a heavy bough snapped and fell, but the loud noise was not followed by any crashing sound. Perhaps an hour later a brief scream/yell was heard just to my north.  It came from a height, and my first thought was an owl in large tree about 25 yards away, but it didn't sound avian at all.  It sounded strangely feminine for some reason.  Reading the BFRO forum I saw owls, cougars, and foxes can emit calls that may be sasquatch-ish, but listening to audio clips of these critters I've found on the internet won't allow me to categorize the sound as any of these known species. Came out to the general area the following week and camped near Lost Lake, about 1.5 miles to the west.  No incidents occurred on this second trip.",

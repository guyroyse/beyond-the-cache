  "observed": "July 17, 2004 My two sons and I were camping this weekend at the One Potato Mineral campground...just up the Forest Service Access Road from Mineral Camp. (Sharp Creeks/Bohemia Mine area).  We were hiking up the steep road leading to the Ghost Town mining area in the early evening.  We kept talking about a \"strange bird sound\"...the \"Whoop-Whoop- Whoop\"...and just dismissed it as some weird bird.  I happened across your website because I was looking for information on the Bohemia Mine. I had chills and goosebumps when I read your journal entry. We also heard \"heavy\" footsteps outside our tent on Saturday night, July 17th.  Then in the very early morning...around 4:00am...I could smell something REALLY nasty. Here...something had \"Marked\" our tarp and our tent.  The urine smell was SO strong...we had to leave our tent tarp behind. I really do believe NOW that we had a \"Sasquatch Encounter\".  Whoa! ",

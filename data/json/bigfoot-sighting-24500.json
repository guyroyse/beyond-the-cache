  "observed": "I looked out the window and saw some monkey looking thing.  It was about 100 yards away.  It was jogging toward the mountains east of where I was.  It was black and looked like it had short fur.  It wasn't very tall.  Maybe four feet.  It kind of ran like a monkey.  You know how monkeys run on their hands sort of crouched over.  I watched for about a minute until it went down into a ditch.",

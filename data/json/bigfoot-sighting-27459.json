  "observed": "On friday march 12 at around 6pm I was going home from the store and when I started to turn off the highway I noticed something white quating down on the side of the highway near the creek about 30-40 yards ahead of me so at that time instead of turning I went on toward it to see what and if I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing and as I got within about 10 yards of it, it stood straight up and turned around slowly and walked into the woods real calm and at that time I couldn't believe what I had just saw. The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it.",

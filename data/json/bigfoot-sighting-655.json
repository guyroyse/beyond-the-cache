Then their bark became a whine and then a whimper.They just lay there shaking and became very quiet. I woke up and I quietlymoved my hand to my hand gun under my pillow. That's when you could heresomething walking in the water that smelled like a bucket of wet diapersor urine soaked fur. We kept our eyes shut and pretended to be asleep untilit was gone, the incident lasted about 4 minutes. Whatever it was brushedup against my hair as it slowly walked by...

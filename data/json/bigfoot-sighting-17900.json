  "observed": "I saw a large black, human shaped figure in the middle of the road about 1/4 mile in front of my vehicle. From the distance it looked larger than a normal human.  When I first saw it I was going down a slight dip in the road.  It appeared that the figure was facing me, but as I approached descending into the dip in the road I could only see the upper body, it was turning and appeared to quickly retreat to the side of the road.  I lost sight because of the dip in the road but when I came up on the other side within about 2 seconds there was no trace of the figure.  The trees are trimmed back about 50 ft so I was surprised that I couldn't see what at the time I thought was a person.  When I got to the area where I thought the figure had entered the woods I slowed to look for it.  I saw nothing.  The woods are pine woods where you can see back under the branches clearly for over 100 ft.  The ground surface was icy with a very sparse snow falling.  I saw no tracks but that could be because of the ice.  It seemed strange to me that someone could exit the road through uneven slippery terrain and disappear before I could get close enough to see what it was.",

  "observed": "Large Humanoid object leaping over drainage ditch in approx. 3 feet wide at side of road. The figure was at least as large as a man, if not bigger, and was completely black (or dark in color).  I was seeing it from aprx. 150 feet away through my car windshield.  It was overcast on Christmas Eve.  It lept with one leg behind it and an arm high above it like a man leaps the long jump in track competitions.  When I got closer I realized that the creature was moving into a heavily wooded area.",

  "observed": "I smelled a strong odor, not a rotting carcass smell but sickly sweet and somewhat garlicy. I looked around for the source of the smell but could not locate [it]. In the same area I heard a screeching vocalization. It was not an animal growl, or raptor screech. I am familiar with bear and mountain lion sounds. This was not any sound I recognized. Footprints found around the area I ate lunch earlier. The ground was hard and rocky so I could not positively identify the tracks, but I am certain they were not bear tracks. The tracks were approximately 14 inches by 6 inches in dimension. I am an experienced outdoor worker. 25+ years with the Forest Service. The odor, sounds, and footprints were unknown to me. That is why I am making a report.",

  "observed": "I was driving home from work a year ago, December. It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the \"man\". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, \"don't come closer\", at least that was the message I got!",

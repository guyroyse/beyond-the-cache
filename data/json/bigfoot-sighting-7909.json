  "observed": "My wife and I live outside the village of elzabethtown in essex county n.y. In the fall of 2002 in october at around 2am my wife stepped out on our porch it was a unusually mild night clear with stars shining . My wife called out for me to come out and join her when she did there was a loud commotion up on the hill beside our house. There was a series of loud screams and thrashing as if something large had been startled by the sound of her voice the screams were unlike any animal I have ever heard and whatever it was was running at full speed through the woods breaking branches as it went . We were both quite shaken and the next morning I went up to site to see if I could find anything but there were no tracks as the ground in the spot is hard and gravelly. I have hunted and fished the area for many years but have never had an incident like that nor have I ever heard any animal in the north country make a sound like those screams",

  "observed": "It was about 7 years ago in a town called Wellsville, New York, in Allegany county. I was around 12 years old, as was my cousin who was with me. It was in the middle of winter, I want to say late January/Early February. It was a decent day outside, and we decided to take a walk on the paths behind her house, which would take you down towards the Allegany River. We were about 1/2 the way down the trail, in a clearing that had woods on one side and a swamp on the other side. All of a sudden we both hear what we thought was an animal or something running through the woods, when (what we believe was a 'bigfoot') ran across the path we were walking on. It wasnt brown like we would have picture bigfoot being, it was more like grayish-white. It appeared to be around 6-7 feet tall. The only noise it made was a growling noise, it was different than a dogs growl. We were terrified and we ran, of course nobody believed us.",

  "observed": "I was camping with my friend and her family in Big Sur California.  It was 1974.   My friend Sylvia and I were sitting on the sand near the beach.  I looked up at the cliffs and I saw something big and black running down a very steep mountain side very fast,not losing its' balance.  I yelled at my friend to look .  She saw it.  We ran as fast as we could back to the safety of our camp.  I remember we were scared to death and we told her aunt and uncle.  I remember we said it looked like a big gorilla.   We were kind of far away from the mountain, but it looked like the creature could have caught up to us fast if it wanted to.   It was quite a scary experience.  I don't know where my friend is but her name is Sylvia Txxxx.  I haven't seen her since 1974.  I don't know where she is but she could corroborate this story.  It seems like a dream now, but I know what I saw.",

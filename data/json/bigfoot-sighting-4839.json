  "observed": "I was driving home around 9:00PM on Bethel Rd. just off of Hwy 200 with my daughter and her son. I came around a curve and saw something ahead on the left side of the road. I applied the brakes slowly and drove on the wrong side of the road to get a better look without saying anything to my family. After I passed it I looked at my daughter and asked her \"What was that?\" She said it looked like a gorilla .I told her it did to me also. My grandson said it just ran across to road into the woods on the other side.It stood upright without a slump like a Gorilla.It ran in the same manner. It was maybe 5 & ½ feet tall with a small head broad shoulders.The color was solid black.",

  "observed": "I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps. This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human. All I seen was the side profile of it. It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long, the shoulder span was very wide. The side profile of the face was flat. It very quickly in three steps crossed the road.(its a wide two lane road). After it crossed I drove forward a little and tried to see where it went but couldn't see it any more. This thing was frightening. I have been looking for it everytime I'm on my route but had not seen it again. On my other route which is on county road 306 about a 10min drive from this incident two days later there was a very strange strong smell in the area around 3am again. The smell was a very strong sweet burning rubber smell, I can't describe it, I never smelled anything like it before. I smelled this for two days straight in this area and then it was gone.",

  "observed": "Each occurrence happened over a two week period. Between the hours of 10:30 P.M. TO 3:00 A.M. Lasting from one to four minutes. The First sounds were that of a whirling shrill whistling then a deep thumping and with the lung capacity of a horse being slaughtered... along with various chattering and screams To hear this once is to not to want to hear it again... But it kept coming back almost every night... Sounded about 200 feet away...looked out windows with small flash light but could not see anything. I Really did not want to see what it was, I was too terrified. Our cabin was located between route 9N and the lake [75 Feet from the lake] The mountain directly behind us was Bloomer Mountain. Sometimes the sounds started far away on top of the Mountain. Then within a minute the sound was coming from the road area. It may have been two calling to each other. We do not own this property any longer. This is one of the most beautiful areas of the world and not heavily populated.",

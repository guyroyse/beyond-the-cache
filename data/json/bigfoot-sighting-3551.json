  "observed": "I and two other friends were sitting around a camp fire late one night cooking hotdogs and talking. I began to hear leaves rustling and sticks breaking as if something was walking around in the woods in front of us. I asked my friends if they had heard it, they had not. Suddenly noise started again, this time we all heard it and quieted down to see if we could tell where the noise (of something walking around) was coming from. We heard a few more steps and then a huge crash, as if something had struck the mobile home just in front of us. It was loud. I asked my friends to put out the fire and told them that we were going to get out of here fast. I ran into our cottage to wake up another friend who was sleeping. I told her what had happened and she immediately got up. At this moment my two friends came in the door. They both were very frightened. Steve had been putting out the fire when he saw a large hairy man-like creature standing about 20 ft from him. He shined his flashlight and saw that it was huge, 7-8 ft tall with red eyes. He called Mike to show him and they both witnessed the creature running off. They said it ran kind of hunched over.",

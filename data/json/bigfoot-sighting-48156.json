  "observed": "In Dec. 1978 I was duck hunting on Stockton Lake, Dade county 5 miles north of Greenfield, MO. At 630 a critter 200-300 yards to my right called a scream twice as loud as a man could call like AWWWWWWWW for 8-10 seconds followed by a OOOOO-o-o-o-o sound very melodic for at total of almost 20 seconds indicating a very big large lungs creature. Another one answered across the lake about 3/4 mile, exactly the same call. Another one about 3-5 miles beyond my launching point, three of them.  Then they all took turns and called for about 5-6 times in order as told to you. I did not know what they were. Told my wife upon returning from the hunt and my two sons. Some years later, I read John Green's book, \"Sasquatch, the Ape among Us\" page 394 where he described a bigfoot call and I'm sure 100% I was hearing three of them like described by John Green. I want to report this to Matt Moneymaker if possible or as a Class B incident. This incident and John Green's info makes me a firm believer in Bigfoot.",

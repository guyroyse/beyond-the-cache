  "observed": "Creature was near a pond, initially bent over he caught sight of us after about 45 seconds of us observing him from about a 45 degree angle looking down and back about 100-150 feet. At first we thought it was a bear, but when he stood up erect and looked at us we knew it was not a bear. I don't think I have ever felt fear like that day. It has been 28 years and I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was a student at the University of Denver at the time and we told everyone at school about the incident. The next two weekends we took several photographers up to Lost Creek and walked all over the area but found nothing.",

  "observed": "I live in a small town in Inman. Im 1993 my son and i had a terrifying experience.  We live in a wooded area. We were on our deck trying out a new telescope we had just bought that day. It was a bright moon lit night. My small dog was walking out at the edge of the woods near a patch of blackberry bushes. She ept barking for two hours at something, so I got concerned and walked out there to see what she was barking at. When i got over there and to a look there was this large hairy animal croouched down in the gully. Which i thought was a large chow dog. So i stomped my foot and yelled at it to go away! when i did it stood up like a human on two feet it had light gray hair and 6ft tall it had large gorilla shoulders and no neck. a flat face it took a long time for it to turn around in slow motion then it started running into the woods knocking down trees. making a loud noise then westarted running too so fast i could not feel the ground it seemed. my son is 6`4 in height and very muscular but he said he felt scared as a child. All we could hear was screaming. My small grandchildren were out side and saw the monster too they call it. they were screaming and crying. we grabbed the children and pushed them inside the house. The next day we went into the woods to check the area we saw gray hair on the trees and large footprints. My neighbor had a large garden close to the woods with lots of squash and other veg. When we checked further in the woods we found huge piles of squash on the ground with large bites where it bit out of them. This thing had hair all over its body and very strong it cracked small trees down like match sticks. We have lots of swamps around here. people have seen lots of black and brown bigfoot creatures near the swamps.",

  "observed": "While driving from Richmond, VA to Charleston, WV, on I-64, I saw what I assumed was a deer run into heavy east-bound traffic. One vehicle had to brake hard to avoid hitting this thing. When it came out between the cars and hit the grassy 70ft. median, it was running like a sprinter runs. I thought \"That's not a deer, it's a man\". He never slowed down when he got to the west-bound lanes and ran right behind a car passing an empty log truck. He almost ran into the rear of the truck, so he stopped. At this time I saw that he was covered from the top of his head to the ground with long dark brown hair. As soon as the truck passed, he sprinted across the lane and into the woods. The middle of his shoulder was even with the bottom of the cradle on the log trailer. When I passed this point, my 30yr. old son saw him running up the hill through the woods.",

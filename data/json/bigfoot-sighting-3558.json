  "observed": "One of my friends and I were camping on his family's land near Catawissa.  It was just the two of us late at night.  We were sitting by the camp fire talking when we noticed we needed more wood for the fire. There was an old apple orchard near by and we scavenged dead wood off of the ground for the fire.  It was a very well lit night, and we could see very well. As soon as we stepped into the orchard, we heard a sort of screeching or wheezing noise around 100 yards away (as best as we could tell).  We didn't think anything of it because we were always hearing noises from around that area, so we continued into the orchard. After about 10 steps in, we heard an awful scream that sounded like it needed two or three heads to make it.  We looked in the direction and then we saw it.  Maybe 50 yards away was the creature. It was about five foot six inches tall and about 350-400 pounds.  It started running at us full speed, and it was incredibly fast.  We immediately turned around and headed out of the orchard and for our car. As soon as we were into the clearing, the creature stopped running at us and turned away.  Needless to say, we put out the fire and left for the night.",

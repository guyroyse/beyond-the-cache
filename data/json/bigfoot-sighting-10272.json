  "observed": "I was squirrel hunting on my grandmothers property, that is around 2 1\\2 miles east of Dayton. I had just walked in a clearing, about 14 x 30ft, surrounded by dense foliage. I had a New England single shot 12 gauge with me. I was looking up into the trees for any sign of squirrels when I caught a movement out of the corner of my right eye. I looked down and to the front of me and saw standing about 15ft away a very large creature. It was about 6ft7in to 7ft tall, very broad shouldered, very hairy except the face. The face was devoid of hair. Coal black eyes, wide nose, very long arms and big hands. It was like I had surprised it. We stared at each other for about 10 seconds, when I cocked my 12 gauge. At that time it turned to its right and disappeared. VERY quickly. It was getting to be dusk but I did look for tracks and found none. There was no smell. I hunted at that location quite often and know the surroundings. That day there were no birds, squirrels or any signs of wildlife whatsoever. It started to get darker so I started home.",

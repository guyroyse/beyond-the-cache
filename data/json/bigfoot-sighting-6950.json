  "observed": "I was driving home on highway 101, between Orick and Klamath.  I have four high powered off road lights on my Jeep, so about 100 yards in front of me, I saw what I thought was a bear on the side of the road.  When I got to be about 50 yards, the thing stood up, and my lights made a silhouette of what looked like a human. As I got closer, I could see a rough outline. My jeep has three-inch lifts, and this thing was much taller than my roof, which stands a good 6.5 feet.  When I got to be 20 yards from the creature, it took one leap off the side of the road, and into the darkness.  That is when the hair stood up on my neck, and I realized I just saw bigfoot.",

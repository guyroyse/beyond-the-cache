  "observed": "I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS! I AM A 38 YR OLD MAN AND A OFFICER OF THE STATE TELLING YOU ABOUT A BIG FOOT. THE FIRST TIME I ENCOUNTERED IT I WAS ON THE WAY INTO TOWN.  THIS ANIMAL WAS ABOUT 6 TO 7 FT TALL AND RAN OUT OF THE WOODS IN FRONT OF ME.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAR, BUT BEARS DONT RUN STANDING ON THIER HIND LEGS AND BEARS IN THIS AREA AREN'T THAT TALL.  I JUST CHALKED IT UP TO THAT IT WAS A BEAR.  UP UNTIL OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. I AM AN ADVID HUNTER AND OUTDOORSMAN.  I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD JUST ABOUT EVERY ANIMAL IN THE WOODS OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY.  ONE AFTERNOON IN MID OCTOBER I WENT OUT TO FEED MY CHICKENS WHEN I SAW SOMETHING SHINEING IN THE WOODS ACROSS THE GULLY FROM MY HOME.  AS I APPROACHED THIS SHINEY OBJECT I REALIZED IT WAS A BALLOON.  I WAS ABOUT TO REACH DOWN AND PICK THE BALLOON UP WHEN I HEARD THIS AWEFUL  CRYING, ANGRY, HURT, MAD, DEEP WITHIN, A HUGE SCREAM THAT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING SOUND I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE THAT MADE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STAND UP.  WHATEVER THIS ANIMAL WAS IT WASN'T MORE THAN 50 YARDS FROM ME, BUT I COULD NOT SEE IT BUT I KNEW IT COULD SEE ME. I CONFIDED IN A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF THIS AREA AND TOLD THEM WHAT I SAW.  TO MY SURPRIZE THEY WEREN'T SHOCKED.  THEY TOLD ME OF A FAMILY OF 3 TO 4 OF THESE ANIMALS LIVING IN THIS AREA AND THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS AREA HAS WITNESSED THEM ALSO.",

  "observed": "I was walking home from my boyfriend's house about an hour after dusk when I heard a very loud, very deep breath. I felt the vibration under my feet when it moved. I had startled it. I looked and saw a huge creature it was 8 or 9 ft. tall and had a huge head 3 times the size of a man's head and it stared at me as I passed by. I prayed and walked as fast as I could without running all the way home. This happened to me in 2006 in Summertown Georgia on Johnson Powell Drive. This is a true story. The most terrifying story of my life.",

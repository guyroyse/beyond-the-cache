  "observed": "A friend and I had a cookout one Friday evening and kept hearing horrible screams and smelling some nasty smell. We finally went in for the night and decided to investigate on Saturday. While out on Saturday, we walked into the heavily wooded area following a power line. The whole time we were out, we felt as if we were being followed. Closer to the creek, we began to see a large, biped figure moving toward the creek. We got scared and headed back toward the road. On the way, we noticed a large footprint in the fresh mud. Later in the month, we found unusual hair on a barbed wire fence. Our zoology teacher ran tests, but couldn't determine the origin. In the fall of every year now, we go out looking and are still finding unusual things. I'd love to help some \"real\" researchers seek bigfoot in this area. I'm very well-educated and can be trusted.",

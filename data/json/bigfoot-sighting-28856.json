  "observed": "Well I live in Rainier WA my name is Matthew I did not see bigfoot but I got some calls or cry's and some hooting. It started one night on 2/4/2011 when I was playing X-box live. I heard this call that I never heard before, so I got out my cell phone and hit record. The next day I was looking on youtube for answers of the call. It was not a fox or a coyote or a dog and too deep for a man. My sister and her friend heard it the same day I got the 1 call on my cellphone. The next night I heard it again, so I got my webcam out the window and record all night long and didn't get anything. On 2/11/2011 I got some more cries on the webcam and 2/12/2011 I heard the cry about 200 yards or closer it gave me goose bumps and made my heart jump 'cause I never heard it so close before. I started to record it but I missed the cry but I got 2 hoots like it is talking to another one. But i hope you guys can help me.  I need some experts to listen to them or I can send them to you guys. All 3 are on youtube.",

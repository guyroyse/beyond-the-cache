  "observed": "About three hours after eating dinner I was sitting around a campfire with 3 friends and my husband.We were just sitting around the campfire and talking when we heard a loud crashing and rustling in the woods about 50 feet from where we were. I guess we all turned at the same time and just sat there in amazement, looking at a set of red glowing eyes. Not like a reflection from an animal, but glowing, much like a red light. What was also very odd about this is that it just stood there and kept watching at us for a minute or so and because it was dark, I could not see the outline of the body but could tell it stood about 8 feet tall. It then turned and walked away making the same crashing noise. Nobody said anything for a few minutes but after the shock wore off we really thought it was very spooky. We have lived, camped, hunted and fished in this county for many years but have never seen anything like this before.",

  "observed": "My friends and I were driving around on all the same roads we do everynite when we spotlight. we got up the road a little bit and we saw this owl in the tree and this one was really close so we stopped to look at it. our windows were down and when we stopped we smelled this awful smell ( like dead people in a funeral home). then the owl flew away and we watched it and when we were getting ready to move again this thing crossed the road in front of us, except when it crossed the road it was at the edge of the hill and stepped in the middle of the road and then onto the top of the embankment. my friends headlights arnt to bright so we only saw the legs and they seemed to be hairy and big but we just wanted outta there and we havent went back since. please get back to me and let me kno if what we saw was bigfoot/sasquatch, Thank you for your time!",

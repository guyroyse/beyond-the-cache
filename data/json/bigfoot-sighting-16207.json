  "observed": "From sept 30th-oct 4th,2006 I was hunting with a friend [name withheld by request] in northern New Mexico Mtns. at about 9,500ft. On the evening of the 2nd I was heading back to camp when I heard a strang sound, like a scream/howl. Now I have hunted the mtns for many years for elk, bear, deer, mtn lions, and turkey, and never heard anything like this before.When I got back to camp my friend, who had started supper made the comment that something strange had happened to him. He said that he heard two sticks being hit together just before he started to camp. I did not tell him about the sounds I heard that night. The next morning I left about an hour before sun-up and headed back toward the same area that I hunted last evening. After sitting for about an hour and a half I got up and moved down an old road to check an elk crossing when I heard the same scream/howl again. I tried to pinpoint the area but never heard it again. When I met my friend at lunch he said he had heard the sticks being hit together again. I asked him to point to the area and he pointed to an area about 200 yards from the area I had heard the scream/howl. I asked him if he heard any screams and he said no.",

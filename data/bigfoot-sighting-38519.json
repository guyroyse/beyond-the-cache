  "observed": "We have a farm with 100 acres, and it is thickly timbered, with lots of wildlife. We do regular ''squatch'' investigations also. We were doing one in late September to October. The early evening with the sun shining through the trees, and when my daughter turned the corner on our gator, as she looked ahead, there was a tall black figure picking leaves off of the tree. The sun was on the opposite side of the figure where you could see the tips/chunks of hair all over it. As we were leaving, we heard four huge howls that could not have been a coyote. We left immediately after this. A few weeks after this encounter in the morning we were just about to head back to the house and were finishing up with some wood-knocks, and rock-clacks. We did one last call, when all of a sudden a rock was thrown at our Polaris. We also got a picture of the animal. It was a very frightening experience and we immediately left and didn't return for a few weeks! Thank you so much for your time!! We would love for you to come to the squatchy Missouri.",

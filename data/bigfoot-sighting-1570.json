Tracks were described as Large (18\"), Medium (15-16\") and Small (13\"). Found by two bear hunters (On foot/No dogs used). Tracks in lower (depressed) area of mud flat filled with rain water. Undetermined age of tracks, but believed to be fairly recent (within last 48 hours) due to lack of degradation of track edges. Plaster cast (single) taken of largest. Cast condition is poor, due to reporting parties lack of familiarity with casting technique. Cast was taken within 24 hours of track discovery.",

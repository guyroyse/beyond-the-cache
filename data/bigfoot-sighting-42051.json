  "observed": "While putting out salt blocks at hunting spots, I saw two creatures.  One was in a wide open area. The other I didn't see until I saw where the first one was moving away from me and headed for the tree line.   I was no more than 25 yards away.  The first one I saw very clearly.  It was approximately 8 feet tall and walking upright.  It had a sloping forehead.  The hands were at about the same level as its knees.  My best estimate would be 600 lbs.  The color was all black.  It had no hair on its face or hands.  The only sound it made was when it walked I could hear the grass being trampled.  It never looked my way or made any vocalization.  Its arms swung slightly while walking with the knuckles facing forward and not to the side like a human. My best estimate on the forearm length would be 16 inches.  When it turned left and into the tree line,  I could see its back clearly.  That's when I saw the other one.  I saw its back only.  Shoulders on both were broad and straight.  Approximately 3 ft across.  I smelled or heard nothing, during, or after the sighting.  After they disappeared, I threw the salt block over the 12 feet embankment and left.  I have not been back since. The only thing I took away from this encounter is all they wanted to do was get away from me.",

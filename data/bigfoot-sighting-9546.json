  "observed": "I am now 57 years old. I have told many people this story but never reported it. I lived in Bradford,  Pa. Where I grew up. I was 15 years old and we played softball at nights with my friends. This incident happen on Church Street, not there now it now South Center St. but we where playing ball one night as we always did. There was about 10 of us playing in a field by the creek on Barbour St. We played until it started to get dark. We all started home in different directions. It was getting dark now and me and my friend was all that was left. So we started home. I stopped because my shoe was untied. I leaned down to tie it and my friend was waiting for me. I started to get up for our trip home when I looked behind us, seeing a very tall figure, standing about 20 yards from us. I said what is that and about that time it started running at us. We ran as fast as we ever had to get out of there. It stopped chasing us. And we to my house where we told my father. We took some flashlights back to the area. but found nothing. To this day I know what chased us. Long arms and maybe 8 to 10 feet tall. I never seen it again but heard screams coming from the hillsides very often.",

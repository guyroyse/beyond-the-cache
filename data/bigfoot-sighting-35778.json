  "observed": "On the full moon in June 2012 about June 4th, in the Sam Houston National forest North of Conroe. Myself and 4 teenage girls (my daughter and 3 others) witnessed after tree knocks and whoops a large animal about 50 yards away staring at us next to a large pine tree. When the girls all 4 screamed a death curdling scream at the same time and one pointed at the animal while it was staring (in the moonlight)....the animal moved across the front of the pine tree where all 4 saw the silhouette moving, blockling out the moonlight.   It was at least 8-9 ft tall and extremely wide.  I found tracks the next day and took a cast of an inch deep impression (in pine needles) about 16-18 inches long. Other tracks were found but it has rained since. I regularly (every 6 mths) visit this spot and have had all sorts of happenings with many witnesses.",

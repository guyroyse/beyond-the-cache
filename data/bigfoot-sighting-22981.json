  "observed": "This occurred in July 2006. I was on my way to work, it was approx, 4:30 AM in the morning. I was riding my motorcycle. I have a extra bright headlight on my motorcycle and I approached an area with a saw mill, I notice something squating beside the road. I slowed and passed this thing and was no more than 4 feet away. I looked right into its eyes and face. The hair was about 2.5 to 3 inches long, black and shiny. I know it was not any animal I had ever seen before. No Bear No Dog nothing. The height if this thing had it stood up would be at least 6.5 feet tall. I continue to ask myself did I just see what I thought I saw. I was to shook up to stop and double check of what I saw. I still to this day wish I had stopped and verified what I saw. Anyhow I still look for it whenever I am night riding.",

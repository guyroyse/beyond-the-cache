  "observed": "I was driving to work one morning between Houston and Willow Springs, Missouri.  I was southbound on US 63, approximately 4 miles south of Houston.  As you approached the bridge over Hog Creek, the road descends a hill and curves to the left.  On the right side of the road there are some farm buildings, with a row of cedar trees planted right along the right-of-way. As I descended the hill, I saw a large, dark creature above the roadside.  It was upright and appeared to be covered in hair.  It was walking towards the cedar trees, and dodged into them as I approached.  My impression was it was over 6' in height, and rather broad through the chest. This would have been sometime around 6:30 in the morning, and there was only early sun.  Shadows were present as well, but I know I saw something.  It moved! When I got to work I mentioned my experience to a couple co-workers, and got a long razzing about it.  I pretty much shut up about it after that. On the way home that evening, I stopped of at the place where I saw \"it\".  There was no evidence of footprints, but some of the leaves and grass were stirred up as if something had come through there.  In comparing my height to the adjacent cedar trees, I also reaffirmed my belief in \"it's\" height.  It had to have been over 6' tall. There are/were bears in southern Missouri, but not as large as what I saw.  Also I don't think a bear can walk upright and take large strides.  I know I saw something there.",

  "observed": "i went fishing last spring. found really weird tracks. i took pictures. i worked in a hospital at that time. i showed the pics to several ortho doctors and 4 podiatrists (foot doctors). they all said the same thing. \"Not made by a person\" as in not h.s.s.. i then showed them to several people that hunt bear. they all said \"not made by a bear\". the tracks had a large toe print,and no arch. they were wider than my size 12 water boot but only 2/3 the length. how do i send these pics to you? they tracks went into an area that was dead ended by 2 creeks. the tracks went in then turned around and went back. the next day i took my go'shein akita out there. he is not scared of anything and has went after a black bear with no hesitation. he hit the tracks, got the scent and turned around and left. i found him back at the car trying to get inside. he hates getting in the car and never does it willingly. he was more than willing then. i have pics of right and left tracks with objects for size reference.",

  "observed": "On July 13 or August 17 of 2000 about 7:15 p.m. my  boyfriend, my 2 moth old baby, and I were headed back from Eureka, CA to Crescent City, CA. Somewhere past Trinidad and right before the lagoon we came around the corner on a four lane highway. Up ahead around 50 yards away a tall dark brown almost black \"man\" with long hair all over ran full stride across the highway. His arms hung long and the top of his neck seemed somewhat hunched over. The first thing that ran through my mind was \"What's a man doing running across the road right here?\"  I thought this because we were completely out in the middle of no where.  Then I yelled, \"That was bigfoot!\" My boyfriend turned to me and said, \"shut up.  You're playing with me.\"  I told him that he saw it with his own eyes.  By this time we had passed the point where he ran across the road into the forest, so we stopped and turned around.  We drove back to the point where he had re-entered the forest and stopped.  Peering into the thick forest it became too spooky for me and I drove off. I noticed where and when he chose to cross the road was very unique.  He waited until there were no cars except for ours which caught him off gaurd just comimg around the corner.  And where he crossed was flat.  It was the only place throughout the woods that didn't have a little hill on either side of the highway.  Some of the people I have told of this ask if it was a bear, but there is no way it could have been at the speed he ran.",

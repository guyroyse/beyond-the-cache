I did have a rifle and a handgun on me because I was out hunting but for some reason I DIDN'T FEEL THREATENED. Although I did turn around and headed back to my car often glancing over my shoulder . I did hear some cracking branches on several occasions and I heard a few low to high tones coming from the direction that the really tall at least 6 feet and shaggy dark brown thing went and what made me walk a little faster was that some of those sounds were answered from the other side of the road .other than that no further sighting and or hearing took place the year",

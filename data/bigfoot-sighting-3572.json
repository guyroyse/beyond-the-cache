  "location_details": "Peach Bottom Township, Village of Delta on the Mason Dixon Line near Cardiff and Whiteford Md. About 6 miles from where the Muddy Creek joins the Susquehanna  River down in a hollow south of the Muddy Creek between SR74 and SR851 lies a pastoral hollow near the creek where there is a clearing served by an old logging trail. During the summers of 1973 through 1976 inclusive there were repeated sightings of a bigfoot like creature that  was recounted by many of the students who attended Kennard Dale High School and would camp and party in that hollow during the summer. Also there were several abandoned Slate quarrys heavily wooded and they provided an incredible degree of nearly inaccessable habitat for the alleged beast.",

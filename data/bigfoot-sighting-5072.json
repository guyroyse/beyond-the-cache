  "observed": "This happened when I was very young. I figured it would have been reported. I was aproxametley 6 years old and was helping my mother cut some weeds out of the feild before my father combined and we discoverd some very large footprints heading from the end of the field towards the house. We stopped my father who was in the combine and showed the tracks to him witch looked very human like. But upon comparison to his foot was very large, and the stride it had taken was very large un reproducable for my father who was 5-11\" . My parents reported it to the sheriffs department and they came and investigated the tracks. Many of the locals and others came and looked at the tracks also. All I know is that it scared me to death and had many a nightmares about it and my father went and bought a big gun in case it came back.",

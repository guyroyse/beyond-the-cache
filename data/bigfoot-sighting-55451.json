  "observed": "My sighting was back in 1993 we lived in Ferry county Malo Washington state. 2.5 miles up rural area road Empire Creek my driveway turned to the left and you would cross over Empire Creek we lived in a small house that we were building. The time of the sighting was around 6am just light enough to see. The first thing that happened was my two outside dogs were barking at something at the corner where the creek ran through then they came running back to the house with their hair up and wouldn't leave the front porch so I looked to where they stopped and thought that I seen someone standing by a tree. I thought what or who is that, I could see that it was very tall over 8feet and it had dark hair the head was smaller than the shoulders but it had no neck. When we made what I want to say is eye contact it took a step back and got parallel with the tree so I couldn't see him but I knew that he was there. I turned my head for just one second to yell at my husband and looked back and he was gone.",

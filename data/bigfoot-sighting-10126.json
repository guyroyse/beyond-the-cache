  "observed": "We hear screams almost every night throughout the spring and summer months. This particular incident occured after midnight, approximately 1:00am. I was awakened by all the neighborhood dogs barking. Even my dog was barking outside my window. Suddenly my dog began to cry. I sat up and walked into the living room and opened the sliding door enough to peek out side and listen to what the dogs were barking at. When I heard a loud scream like screeching then it turned into a loud holler. This screaming sounds went on for about ten minutes and came closer to my home. I then closed the sliding door and continued to peek out my living room window. I saw this tall hairy thing like a man standing next to the other window looking inside my home. I got down on all fours and began to crawl into the kitchen where he couldn't see me. I remained there for about five minutes, then looked toward the window where he was standing and could not see him. I crawled to the window and peeked out. I saw it walking into the dark carrying something in its hand. The next morning when I looked out my front porch my deer jerky that was hanging to cure was gone.",

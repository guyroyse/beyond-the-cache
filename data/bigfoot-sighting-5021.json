  "observed": "In the Spring of 1973, somewhere between Homer & Haynesville, LA, our family lived deep in a heavily wooded area. One particular night, our dogs were acting strange. They wouldn't go outside, rather, tucked their tails & hid!  All the usual night sounds had ceased & there was a weird 'stillness' to the air. Soon we began to hear the limbs, etc. breaking across the road from us & it seemed to be made by something BIG! There was also a peculiar odor in the air we'd never smelled before. Needless to say, our children were scared & so was I. The next morning my husband checked on the damage but couldn't figure out what had made such a trail. We also heard from a distant neighbor up the way that \"something\" had stepped upon their porch & when they went to get the shotgun, \"it\" had left...but also left behind a bit of coarse dark hair on a nail. It wasn't too long after that we moved, but I will never forget the \"excitement\" of that time.",

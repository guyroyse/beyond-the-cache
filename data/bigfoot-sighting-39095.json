  "observed": "2:30 am driving home from work when a large dark animal crossed the road in front of my car. I was traveling 35-40 mph and the animal appeared to glide across the road at an extremely fast speed. It was literally a blur until it was directly in my headlights. It appeared to be running on two legs with a heavy upper body. It also appeared to cross the road in two strides. I slammed my brakes and turned towards the farm field it ran into. There was nothing in site. The ground was frozen which is why I believe there was no tracks. There is not any animal that lives, that could explain what I saw.",

  "observed": "Since October I have had many howls, wood knocks, eyeshine instances. I believe they have always frequented the hardwoods across the street, but since the recent logging of thousands of acres of pine in the area they have taken up full time residency across the street. There is a large swamp that butts up to the hardwoods. The night of January 21st, 2017 was the most incidental of all so far. After making some calls on my front porch I got a wood knock from the woods across the street. My dog ran toward the activity and barked for a long time. When I heard his collar stop jingling and the barking stopped I got worried and went into the woods with a large limb. I beat against a large oak and yelled \"I want my Dog!\". I heard a woodknock close by then a chest beat and a bluff charge through the brush. Then a tree push down. I yell roared \"I want my Dog!\" and beat hard against the tree. I saw eyeshine ahead I I told him to back away so my dog will come to me and we will go home. He did and my dog came out and we went home.",

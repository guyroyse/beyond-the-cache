  "observed": "In 1979 I was upstate hiking in the adirondacks upstate New York.I got ahead of the group and off the main trail watching beavers working.As I walked back to the main trail I flushed something out of thick brush. It ran diagonally towards me on the main trail.I could hear a loud thump-thump of feet pounding the main trail and it was wailing like a womans scream or something similar.It ran partially into view and was about four and a half feet tall with dark brown fur with lighter tips and was moving fast upright.I assumed it was a bear cub and got away from the area.I am not from bear country and only found out years later it is unlikely a cub would run upright for the 150 or so feet I witnessed.I probably wouldn't have given it more thought but the sounds I heard are a minature version of some vocalizations on these bigfoot sights.There were some other strange things on this trip and years later a friend I work with told me a similar story that happened around the same year and less than 30 miles away.",

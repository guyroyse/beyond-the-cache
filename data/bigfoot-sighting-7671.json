  "observed": "I was driving north on 259 from Henderson, TX at approximately 1:30 am. I was about 9 to 9 1/2 miles from the Alford Landon Loop around Henderson. There was patchy fog. I had crossed over 2 creeks and saw a very large, dark figure just off the highway to my right. It was standing next to a group of trees that jutted out from the wooded area. I didn't slow down to get a better look because quite frankly, I was scared to death! I had just gotten off work where I am a nurse. I had been at work for an extremely long time (19 hrs) and I was very tired, but not too tired to pay attention to my surroundings. Most of my training for working is attention to detail.",

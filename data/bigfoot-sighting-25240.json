  "observed": "My significant other and I lived in a house near ( about 2 miles ) from Turkey Run State park. It first started out, we were sitting near a fire we had built in our yard when I kept getting the feeling I was being watched..This was probably 9 or 9:30 at night. My partner asked me what was wrong to which I told him. A few minutes later, The cattle pastured behind our house started bawling and running like something either scared them or was chasing them. My partner stepped out to the side of the garage ( Which was beside the house ) and called me to come look, which when I got there, there was something tall standing in the moonlight. He then picked up a piece of steel pipe, his weapon of choice, and threw it at the shape, which did'nt move and we then assumed it was a pine or cedar tree. We went in the house shortly there after, but I still could not shake the \" being watched \" thing. The next morning, we went back out to where the tree was supposed to be and there was NO tree !! He threw a big rock at the spot where he'd threw the pipe the night before and actually hit the pipe on the ground with the rock. We walked out to where these items were and the grass was all beat down and trails led out through the pasture where the cattle are. There was two distinct trails, the grass was waist high and you could tell the one whatever used to come up and the one it used to go back by the direction the grass was laying.",

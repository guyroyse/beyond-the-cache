  "observed": "I was hunting with my uncle and Father-in-law Off Bear Den Lake Rd in Montmorency County. Opening day we went out all day. At dusk I came out a bit early to where Bear Den intersects the highway to wait for my companions. While I was waiting I stepped out of my vehicle to listen for them or gun shots. While I was waiting right before it was too dark to see I heard a roar unlike anything I have ever heard. I have spent endless hours on those trails and NEVER heard  anything like that. It was terrifying. I nearly cried as I sped away in my jeep. It was so close I could feel my chest rumble from the sheer power of the roar. I knew instantly that whatever it was, it wanted me to leave now... I went to the Elbow Inn where we were supposed to meet. My In-Laws were already there. They said they had weird noises and a strange feeling all day in their blinds. As if they were not alone. We didn't stay at the cabin that night, in fact we all went home that night took the full 4 hour drive we were so frightened. Father-in-law and uncle have not been back since. I have only been back in that area during the day and still feel uneasy about it.",

  "observed": "At 8:12 pm on Saturday, Feb.14, 2009 my husband and I were in our upstairs bedroom with the windows open when we heard a very unusual sound from outside. I turned down the television and we listened at our open window and heard the sound again. It was an animal sound coming from the wooded areas around our house. I could only describe the sound as a monkey-like whooping sound. The animal made this series of whooping sounds only twice.The neighborhood dogs responded by barking. My husband quickly told me that he had heard unusual animal calls the night before while letting our dogs out in the yard. We are very familiar with the usual wildlife that frequents this area and neither of us have ever heard anything similar before.",

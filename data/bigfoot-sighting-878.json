  "observed": "Myself and two friends were at Highbanks Metro Park hiking on trails.  As it got dark, we decided to walk back to the car by way of the park's paved roads.  We first heard the creature in the woods to our right.  It was running and we could hear it was something really big and heavy.  It was also making a sound that made our skin crawl. We stopped in our tracks.  About 25 to 50 yards ahead, it appeared from the woods on the right and ran across the road into the woods on the left.  It was completely white and must have been about 7 feet tall.  We then heard it coming towards us in the woods so we ran.  My friend was so scared he was crying.  We ran into a park officer who didn't believe us and told us to go home. Please note: see transcipt of Dispatch article regarding \"white monster sighting\" dated 1977.  Could this be the same creature?",

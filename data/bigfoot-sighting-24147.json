  "observed": "I was with a friend,we were going to the quarry to go fishing at night,it was about 9pm,I was walking in the lead down a path to the quarry,the path drops off sharply at the edge of the quarry,about a 15 foot drop,so you have to kind of run down it,there was a small sandy area at the bottom next to the water and a path that went all the way around,the area was surrounded with tall weeds and brush,as I ran down the slope I saw a big hairy thing I can only describe as a tall humanoid covered with long hair(about four inches,reddish brown)it was tall and lankey and kind of reminded me of a basket ball player,it was bent over facing away from me,almost neeling on the ground,I was no more than ten feet away from it and as soon as I saw it I turned around and ran back up the incline scared to death hoping it wasnt following me,as I was comming back up I almost ran into my freind who was just at the edge of the drop off,he asked me what I was doing and I was afraid to tell him what I saw,we then went fishing,and I never spoke of it",

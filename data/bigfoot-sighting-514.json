  "observed": "I was driving home from work and it was about 7 o'clock in the evening. I had my headlights on. I live in Sorrento, La. off of Hwy. 61 (Airline Hwy)  About two miles from home (driving west) on 61 I saw a creature. I always look at this time for deer, armadillo, possum, dogs, etc.. While I was looking off the passenger side of the road, this creature sprung up from the ditch. My headlights shined right on the front of it. It was somewhat like a sloth. Hairy all over, but a light gray color. It had a small round head with a brown nose. The eyes did not glow, but were white around them. It had extra long arms and a very thin body. It was at least 6-7 feet tall. I couldn't believe what I had seen. I wanted to turn around, but there was no turn crossing. Alone, I just kept driving. It stood upright and seemed to be leaping up out of the ditch. Its hair was not long and bushy, but sleak and close to the body. I seemed smart. Unlike the sloth, it was man-like.",

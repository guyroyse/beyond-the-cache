  "observed": "About 7 or 8 months ago, on Co Rd 129 outside of Tyler Texas, a creature crossed the road in front of me. It was about 6 ft tall dark, burnt orange hair all over its body, it ran slowly across the road into woods. Was on two feet upright. I got a very good look at it and was very disturbing. Nothing i have ever seen before. I did not report at the time, didnt think people would believe me. Then on april 3, 2011, on my way back from Frankston Texas on hwy 155 just before Brookshire's grocery store on right going north we saw the same type of creature standing on the edge of the tree line of a large wooded area. same description. My son and i both saw it for 10 to 15 seconds. I pulled over on road got out and walked into woods and saw nothing. This is twice I'm sure we saw the unexplained.",

# Converting from Hashes to RedisJSON #

For the most part, this is pretty straight forward. We'll be replacing calls to `.hSet()` and `.hGetAll()` with calls to `.json.set()` and `.json.get()`. Before we do this, however, clean out your database as any exisitng Hashes won't work with the code we're going to change:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> FLUSHALL
OK
```

Go ahead and open **`routers/sightings-router.js`** as this is where we'll be making our changes. Find any code in there that calls `.hSet()`. Like this line here:

```javascript
  redis.hSet(key, { id, ...req.body })
```

Replace it with code that calls `.json.set()`:

```javascript
  redis.json.set(key, '$', { id, ...req.body })
```

As you can see, `.json.set()` take three arguments: the key, the path within the JSON document that we want to set, and a JavaScript object that is to be the contents at that path. In our case, we want to set the root of our document to the passed in JavaScript object so we specify `$` as our path.

Next, find any code that calls `.hGetAll()`:

```javascript
  const sighting = await redis.hGetAll(key)
```

Replace it with code that calls `.json.get()`:

```javascript
  const sighting = await redis.json.get(key)
```

We're not specifying the path of `$` here as it's the default. But if we wanted to, we would include it as part of the call options. Like this:

```javascript
  const sighting = await redis.json.get(key, { path: '$' })
```

We could even provide multiple paths if we were so inclined:

```javascript
  const sighting = await redis.json.get(key, { path: [ '$.state', '$.county' ] })
```

That's most of the code, but let's go ahead and change `.unlink()` to `.json.del()`. It's not strictly necessary, as deleting the root of a JSON document in Redis does the same thing as just UNLINKing a key. But let's be complete and find the calls to `.unlink()`:

```javascript
  redis.unlink(key)
```

And replace them with this:

```javascript
  redis.json.del(key)
```

This should work, but, there's some flaws in our code.


## Removing the Transaction ##

Take a look at this code that handles the PUT:

```javascript
sightingsRouter.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const key = sightingKey(id)

  await redis.multi()
    .unlink(key)
    .json.set(key, '$', { id, ...req.body })
      .exec()

    res.send({
      status: "OK",
      message: `Sighting ${id} created or replaced.`
    })
})
```

If `.json.set()` replaces the entire document, is the call to `.unlink()` needed? If it's not, is the transaction needed?

The answer to this leading question is no. So, let's clean this up a bit and remove the transaction. When you're done, your code should look like this:

```javascript
sightingsRouter.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params
  const key = sightingKey(id)

  redis.json.set(key, '$', { id, ...req.body })

  res.send({
    status: "OK",
    message: `Sighting ${id} created or replaced.`
  })
})
```

Much tidier.


## Testing the Changes ##

So that was a lot of changes without a lot of testing. Let's fix that. We had several `curl` commands back when we where writing all this code to work with Hashes. Run them again and see if they work. As you run them, look in RedisInsight and see what they change.

Also, note that we are now adding a different file. Before, we were adding files form the **`docs/hash`** folder but *now* we are adding docs from the **`docs/json`** folder. The files there have more data and are a little JSON-y:


### Add a Bigfoot Sighting ###

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @../data/json/bigfoot-sighting-8086.json \
  localhost:8080/sightings
```


### Get a Bigfoot Sighting ###

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8080/sightings/<your ulid>
```


### Replace a Bigfoot Sighting ###

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @../data/json/bigfoot-sighting-1024.json \
  localhost:8080/sightings/<your ulid>
```


### Remove a Bigfoot Sighting ###

```bash
curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/sightings/<your ulid>
```

----------------------------------------

Assuming that is now all working, we can take a look at [RediSearch](16-REDISEARCH-BASICS.md) and finally get rid of that call the `.keys()` that is bugging us. And implement the rest of our routes in **`routers/sightings-router.js`**.

# Installing Redis Stack & RedisInsight

We'll be using [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) for our flavor of Redis. Redis Stack includes the Redis that you know and love plus several modules that extend it's capabilities. More on modules later.

We'll also be using [RedisInsight](https://redis.io/docs/stack/insight/) which is a graphical client for Redis. We'll use it to issue commands and browse our database.

## Installing Using Docker

Installing with Docker is pretty easy. Just run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

And that's it. You now have Redis Stack installed and running. _And_ you now have RedisInsight running too. To use it, just point your browser at http://localhost:8001 and browse your database.

## Running Your First Command

Let's confirm that the installation of Redis Stack is working by entering our first command from RedisInsight.

- [ ] Select workbench on the left naviagtion bar to access the command-line console.

- [ ] Enter `PING` into the console and click the play button.

- [ ] Observe the `PONG` in response.

## Next Steps

I'm gonna be giving you a lot of Redis commands. Don't expect screenshots all the time, as they're kind of a pain for me make and hard for you to copy and paste from. So, instead, future command-line examples will often be presented in the following format:

```
127.0.0.1:6379> PING
PONG
```

This is the format used by `redis-cli`, the command-line client that ships with Redis.

And that's it. Now, let's start looking at some [Redis basics](02-REDIS-BASICS.md).
